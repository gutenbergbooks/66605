<p>&#8220;Allah! Allah! Bishmillah. El Traprock,
Dhub ak Moplah!... Wullahy! Wullahy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Long, long after their echoes have died away the
cries of my desert men ring on my ears. Still do
I see myself as, in a cloud of dust, at the head of
my band of picked nomads, my burnous floating
above me so that I looked like a covered wagon,
with the drumming thunder of a hundred hoofs and
the wild yells of my followers, I swept like a
cyclone to the rescue of one of the fairest creatures
of my favorite sex.</p>

<p>O Sarah! my desert mate, whom I have hymned
in terms of pomegranates, peacock&#8217;s-eyes and alabaster
columns, lovely lady for whom I trained my
tongue to the notes of the nightingale and my
fingers to the intricacies of the lute, elusive creature,
startled doe that ever fled before my bent bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and keen-edged arrows only to be struck down at
last by agonizing love, light of my spirit, breath of
my soul, warmth of my body, why, O all-of-these-and-much-more,
did&#8217;st thou flee from El Sheik
Traprock, Dhub of the Moplah Tribe?... Wullahy!</p>

<p>Alas! She may not answer, my fair bride of the
silences, for she has been plucked from me, she has
passed beyond my ken. Let me then speak for her,
my sweet bird, my tower of gold-and-ivory, my tall
building agleam with rubies, my ... but first let
me descend from the heaven of her memory and
cease from singing of the musical Moplahs.</p>

<p>In other words let me get back to earth and, in
regular language, try to describe her as I first saw
her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on the pier-head at Cannes: the time, sunset.
She stood, outlined against the flaming sky,
a tall, angular figure. In the fading light I took
no note of details but there was that in the woman&#8217;s
silhouette which gripped me. My heart stopped
... missed a beat ... and hurried on.</p>

<p>Strange and mysterious, the influence of human
personalities! Her mere presence was a challenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
at which I bristled. Through my nerve-centers
flashed deep messages of interest, attraction ...
animosity. Here, plainly, was no easy quarry.</p>

<p>As tense and alert as a setter on-the-point I stood
watching the lean figure. At the back of my head
I felt a light tickling sensation as if a hand had
passed upward over my hair; my nostrils, I dare
say, dilated.</p>

<p>Her back was toward me and she was gazing at
the luminous waters of the &#8220;Baie des Anges.&#8221;
Caught in her close-cropped, reddish-brown hair
the last sun&#8217;s rays shone in a golden aureole so that
in this respect she might have been one of the angels
for whom the bay is named. But the angelic suggestion
ended there. In all else she was warm,
vital, human, a vibrant personality with a hint of
almost masculine strength beneath the folds of her
tan silk jacket and short walking skirt. One arm
was akimbo and through the triangle thus formed
I could see, by odd coincidence, the distant shape
of my yawl, the Kawa, from which I had just
landed.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>My arrival in Cannes had been meaningless, the
chance debarkation of a wanderer in search of rest
after arduous voyaging in the far North, the aimless
pursuit of warmth, comfort and sunshine. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
had intended, as far as my formless plans had any
intention, stopping over the night at Cannes, then
pushing on to the various Mediterranean ports,
through Suez to the great East. My vague objective
was the Nicobars, off Sumatra, where I had
promised to call on a devoted old Andamanian
when the opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Now, in an instant all that was changed. Vanished
my Andamanian friend, my vague intentions.
Here, within a few feet of me, in the person of this
unknown woman was adventure, mystery, romance,
an immediate objective, a citadel to be stormed, a
problem to be solved, an adversary to be overcome,
a mate to be ... who knows what lies in wait for
him around the corner? I only know that in a
twinkling life had become purposeful, fascinating,
electric.</p>

<p>She seemed to feel something of this riotous zip
which I was projecting toward her for she turned
suddenly and with a quick, awkward gesture,
pulled on a soft straw hat and began walking in my
direction. I immediately withdrew among a maze
of packing-cases, orange boxes and other freight
with which the pier was cumbered. Instinct told me
it was not the time for our meeting. I had come
ashore only for a few necessary supplies and I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
very much in fatigue uniform. Also I was bare-footed
in which condition a man can never look his
best.</p>

<p>A moment later she strode unsuspectingly past
the pile of orange boxes which screened me. I
caught the impression of a distinctly patrician type
with rigidly drawn features in which an aquiline
nose predominated. I had only a glimpse but, as
in the wink of a camera shutter, a clear image of
that austere profile was imprinted upon the sensitive
plate of my soul. Developing and printing
were to come later. One thing was certain; she was
a personage, not a mere person.</p>

<p>At the end of the pier she vanished. Vaulting
from my fruit crate I made toward the string-piece
where my dingy was gently bumping. I must
make ship and haul my evening clothes from stowage.
Once more I was on the trail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fate does not cheat those who trust her. Without
arrangement on my part I saw my lady again
within three days. It was bound to happen.</p>

<p>Though changed entirely as to costume, I knew
her instantly. She was at the roulette table in the
glittering salle-de-jeu at Monte Carlo. From afar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
I saw the tip of a blue ostrich plume, the nodding
feathers of which seemed to brush against my consciousness.
They could belong to none other.</p>

<p>Again the imperious call and challenge flashed
between us as I took a seat opposite hers where I
could study her features while I tossed my chips
on the table. She looked up at once and I held her
with my gaze. For the first time our glances met.
I was oblivious of my surroundings. The brilliant
room, the gay crowd, the alert croupier, all sank
into nothingness as I focussed my eyes on hers, resolved
that in this first interchange I should not
yield. Her eyes, amazingly blue, looked into mine
for a long instant, then dropped to the Cross of St.
Botolphe which glittered on my shirt-bosom. I
wore no other jewels save the agate-and-iron signet
ring which his Britannic majesty&mdash;but that is
neither here nor there. A faint smile played at the
corners of my lady&#8217;s lips. It was enough. She had
taken note of my presence.</p>

<p>She was plainly a great lady of the type which
England alone can produce, one of those rangy,
imperial, dominating creatures in whom seem to be
compacted innumerable generations of conquering
invaders, Derby-winners, stalwart cricketers and
astute statesmen. The prevailing color of her person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
was red, or, to be more accurate, sandy, the short
hair being without any tinge of the pink or henna
which reeks of the coiffeurs&#8217; art. Her complexion
was of a salmon or apricot shade, made almost
golden by the overtone of pale, downy fuzz which so
often accompanies it. Crowning the crisply curled
locks was a regal tiara of large emeralds into which
the blue ostrich feather was stuck at a jaunty angle.
Never before had I seen a tiara on bobbed hair and
the effect coupled with the red and green color
scheme was extremely diverting. One felt at once
that here was a woman who would dare anything.</p>

<p>Being black myself the aureate color of her skin
struck on my heart like a gong. Her brows and
lashes were so pale as to be almost albinesque.
Above and below a generous, full-lipped mouth her
dominant nose contended for supremacy with an
obstinate chin. Tanned cheeks spoke plainly of
life in the open as did her strong but well-kept
hands upon which shone several important emeralds.
But what stirred me most were her arms.</p>

<p>Costume makes little or no impression on me.
The general effect of what she wore was hard and
steely, but gorgeous. The color was mainly white
with a great slash of sky-blue introduced somewhere.
I had the feeling of being in the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of a lady-mayor or an important ambassadress. In
any case, her arms were exposed beyond the elbow
and to my delight they were generously freckled,
not with coarse, country-style, ginger-bread mottlings,
but with fine, detached discs no bigger than
pin heads and pure gold in color. Over these pale
paillettes grew the silky fur of which I have spoken.
For some reason freckles always excite me, probably
because I can never hope to have any except
vicariously.</p>

<p>She was playing for high stakes, using only hundred-franc
chips and winning with a consistency
that attracted the inevitable cortege about her chair,
the jackals who try to follow a winner or steal a
system by peering over one&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>I could but admire the coolness with which she
turned and pushed away the face of an ornamental
Russian woman, the Princess Sonia Subikoff,
notorious adventuress and parasite, whose covetous
features kept thrusting themselves under the player&#8217;s
elbow. Done by one less sure of herself the
action would have provoked a terrific scene. As it
was, the outraged Princess, <i>soi-disant</i>, struck
savagely at the blonde back of the English woman.
The blow resounded as if she had hit a packing-case,
producing no more effect than a shrug and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
cheerful grin as <i>la</i> Subikoff made off, nursing a
lame hand and hissing spiteful comment on the
<i>animal anglaise</i>. Coolly, superbly, the Anglo-Saxon
continued her play, placing her chips with
a nonchalant sweep of her great arms. In every
movement was the same underlying hint of powerful
bony sub-structure.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Elle est dure</i>,&#8221; said a voice at my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Qui &ccedil;a?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>La belle laide, en face.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned with an instinctive hostility toward the
speaker, his voice, manner ... everything. To
discuss a woman, openly, in a public place....
<i>La belle laide!</i> ... and yet, was she not just
that? There is a merciless precision in the Latin
tongue.</p>

<p>My neighbors were a type I detest,&mdash;Peruvians,
I judged by the barbarous Spanish clang of their
French; sleek, oily, anointed with perfume from
their lacquered hair to their equally shining boots,
tailored, corsetted, manicured and with that fawning
look so unpleasantly suggestive of the oriental.
One was playing for small stakes while his companion
looked on, but I noticed that both were narrowly
watching the English woman and exchanging
whispered comments.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Something was in the wind and my submerged
sense of suspicion began to stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Flute!</i>&#8221; cried one of the South-Americans,
which is a strong imprecation in French, &#8220;She wins
like a fiend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Zut</i>,&#8221; replied the other as his last chip passed
under the rake.</p>

<p>I turned to my own play, a system which I
picked up in Buenos Ayres, a sure winner of small
amounts. After two hours I was four and a half
francs ahead and the pastime was beginning to bore
me. Rising, I saw that the Peruvians had separated,
one having crossed to the other side of the table
directly back of the English woman while the other
loitered near the croupier&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>In a flash I divined their plan just in time to
act. As the man near the croupier engaged him
in conversation I saw the other&#8217;s hand shoot out
and seize a large pile of bank-notes weighted down
with a stack of golden louis. I could not possibly
reach the fellow or the louis, but I could and did
reach the door.</p>

<p>As our paths converged I saw that in his left
hand he held an automatic. Acting entirely on instinct
I threw in his face a handful of small change,
keys, pen-knife, etc., from my trouser pocket. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the same instant I dove. His bullet roared, harmless,
over my head and together we crashed to the
marble floor. The thief had never seen a foot-ball
game and expected something entirely different.</p>

<p>As we struggled he attempted to turn the weapon
on me but my grip was like steel. The room
was in an uproar. Hither and yon we threshed
about over the polished pavement. In one of our
gyrations my foot caught under the teak-wood base
of a huge Japanese jar. Fascinated I watched it
tremble, totter ... and fall into a thousand fragments
about us. Then the confusion was punctuated
by a sharp report and my adversary lay suddenly
still. He had shot himself during the struggle,
whether by accident or design I can not say.</p>

<p>Rising I looked about and tendered a handful of
golden coins and <i>billets-de-banque</i> to the tall, masterful
woman who stood near me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top-hole,&#8221; she said, quite simply. &#8220;You must
come to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She handed me her card, which I accepted, bowing.
There were some tedious formalities necessary
at the local <i>poste de police</i> and it was after
midnight when I reached my room and took the
card from my pocket. &#8220;Lady Sarah Wimpole,&#8221; I
read beneath a simple crest, a swan volant holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
a snake in its beak and the device &#8220;<i>Nunc pro
tunc.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Our paths had crossed. Matters were coming on
apace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Traprock?&#8221;</p>

<p>She held the card which had preceded me. Saluting
in the continental manner, I bent over her extended
hand, noting the strong, square nails with
their perfect crescent moons at the base.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Wimpole.&#8221;</p>

<p>She motioned me to a complicated wicker chair
of Malaysian make which brought back vividly my
years in Mindanao.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were splendid the other night,&#8221; she said.
Her voice surprised me. It was harsh, like the note
of a grackle or the cry of a sea-bird, full of strange
breaks, guttural depths and moving dissonances.</p>

<p>As we talked I took in the details of our surroundings.
We were seated in the morning-room
of the Villa Bianca, an exquisitely appointed mansion
of lemon-yellow stucco embowered in a riot of
roses, bougainvill&eacute;a and flowering bugloss-vines.
From beyond the walls of the formal entrance garden
the noises of the town reached us faintly. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Monocan populace were celebrating the f&ecirc;te of St.
Yf whose favor is supposed to bring good luck at
the gaming tables.</p>

<p>Glancing at my hostess I re-experienced the conviction
that she was a surprising woman. Odd indeed
was the contrast she made with her surroundings.
The room was of an indescribable daintiness.
Overhead arched a pale blue plaster dome
upon which painted birds flitted among fleecy
clouds or perched upon blossoming branches. The
side-walls, except for door and window openings,
were covered with coral pink studded regularly
with small crystal buttons, the spacing being accentuated
by a connecting diaper-design of silver
thread.</p>

<p>From the cornice, at the beginning of the dome,
hung a deep valance of white lace which was repeated
in the long window curtains and innumerable
cushions on chairs, <i>chaise-longue</i> and foot-stools.
The whole room, in fact, seethed with a
sort of suds of lace and <i>chiffonerie</i> like an old-fashioned
valentine in the midst of which Lady
Sarah sat enthroned in a curious chair contrived to
represent a sea-shell.</p>

<p>Her costume, as nearly as I could make it out,
was a voluminous silk prowler or slip-cover of silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
matching the walls, and like them, edged with lace.
An intricate mob-cap covered all but a severe bang
of red-brown hair which shrieked at its dainty surroundings
as loudly as the green parrot who,
raucous and unconfined, swung acrobatically about
his perch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Selim,&#8221; commanded the bird&#8217;s mistress;
then, having noted my looks of appraisal,
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this place hideous? I hate a room that foams
at the mouth. My husband takes it for the season.
Poor creature, his taste is ghastly; he was born in
Nottingham. This house was built by the government
for one of the old king&#8217;s mistresses. It gives
Wimpole a thrill merely to rent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank back languidly into the recesses of her
shell, suppressing a yawn and I could see the faint
lines running from the corners of her eyes to the
lobes of her ears, lines of disillusionment, of hunger
denied, of ...</p>

<p>During the interval since our meeting at the
Casino I had learned something of her tragic story.
Born amid the highest and most refined nobility,
the daughter of Sir Rupert Alleyne and Mary,
Lady Beaverboard, she had seen her ancestral fortune
lost by her father in speculative adventures induced
by the old taint of the Alleyne madness. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
his fifty-third year Sir Rupert inherited by the
laws of succession the estates and titles of the
Beaverboard interests, becoming subsequently
Duke of Axminster. These honors marked the beginning
of the end.</p>

<p>The final crash came with Sir Rupert&#8217;s attempt
to corner the Italian antique market together with
all the important trans-atlantic steamship lines, his
idea being to completely control the American demand
for ancestral portraits and <i>objets d&#8217;art</i>. The
stately halls of Alleynecourt were thronged with
continental adventurers freighted down with spurious
Botticelli, Allegretti and other masters.</p>

<p>When the Duke, raving, was carted away to Old
Drury, his daughter sought refuge with her uncle,
Egbert Alleyne, whose scientific works on graptolites
and stromatoporoids kept him impoverished
and ill-at-ease in a tiny cottage in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>Here Horace Wimpole found her. He was at
that time senior partner in the firm of Wimpole &amp;
Tripp, laces, of Nottingham, with a peerage in view
and an o&#8217;er-vaulting snobbery which he saw prospects
of gratifying by an alliance with the penurious
but well-connected Sarah Alleyne. On her
side it was a bitter bargain,&mdash;her youth, her rugged
beauty, her hopes of romance in exchange for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
wealth and comfort for herself and her crazed sire.
She accepted.</p>

<p>A week after the Westminster Gazette announced
the bestowal of a title upon Horace, Lord
Wimpole, the ennobled merchant led his aristocratic
bride from the church portico. Blithely rang
the bells of St. George&#8217;s and lustily rose the cheers
of the bluff English onlookers whose worship of
nobility and all the panoply thereof is the enduring
wonder of the world. Wimpole promptly did his
duty by his father-in-law and had the ancient zany
removed from Old Drury to a private padded-cell
in a fashionable asylum. The old man&#8217;s last
whimsy was that he was Admiral Napier and he
was given the run of a small garden where, in full
uniform and spy-glass in hand, he made observations
and issued authoritative commands.</p>

<p>Lady Wimpole was now free, except for the encumbrance
of her low-bred husband who had virtually
retired, master of a colossal fortune by means
of which he proposed to live up to his new estate.</p>

<p class="caption">Lord Horace Wimpole</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />
<p>It was here he made his fatal error. As a business
man he was a success, for he ran true to type,
but as an aristocrat he was a hopeless false-alarm.
Contrary to previous statements, in matters of
breeding kind hearts can not compare with coronets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
particularly when the latter have been in the
family for ten generations.</p>

<p>Finding himself a failure in the fields of sport,
riding to or from the hounds, cricket and the active
exercises, intellectually unable to compete in cultural
pursuits such as the writing of memoirs or
the collecting of sea shells and butterflies, Wimpole
was thrown back on the last recourse of affluent
ignorance, travel and dissipation.</p>

<p>In the latter field he showed a natural aptitude
which, had it been caught and cultivated in some
previous generation, might have made him a rather
attractive rake. But it came too late; he was merely
beastly. Lady Wimpole was quite frank about
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband,&mdash;is he with you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She raised her beautiful pinkish eye-lids toward
the ceiling. &#8220;Still asleep ... he was unusually
crocked last night. You know he has taken up the
vices. He tries to be brutal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he beat you?&#8221; I put the question frankly
because I knew it was the traditional thing and
I felt that she would appreciate a direct method.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said simply. &#8220;He would like to but
he doesn&#8217;t dare. He does his worst however. He
bites.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>She slipped back the soft sleeve of her gown and
extended an arm. I shrank back in horror. The
dog! A semi-circle of teeth-marks marred the
salmon-silkiness of the loveliest fore-arm in the
world.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I paled and yet felt curiously relieved.
This proof of dastardly conduct on her
husband&#8217;s part seemed to make easier the thing
I knew I should eventually have to do, namely,
take this gorgeous creature from him.</p>

<p>Turning toward the parrot to hide my emotion
I said &#8220;Madame,&mdash;I am sorry to bring you bad
news ... but we are both summoned to appear
before the local police magistrate the day after
tomorrow. The charge is murder. You are a
material witness. The affair is entirely technical,
but there are unseen influences at work. The
young man,&mdash;the scoundrel who attempted to steal
your gold, was well-connected, of an old Peruvian
family. They have cabled representations
to the Monacan government. The whole affair
has the look of a nasty, political embroglio. It
may last some time. I was once called as a witness
to a trolley accident in Jerusalem and six
months afterward....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will hear all that later. Today is Tuesday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Call for me Thursday morning&mdash;what is the hour?
eleven? Good&mdash;be here at ten-thirty: I will not
fail you. Adios.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again saluting her <i>&agrave; la fran&ccedil;aise</i>, I departed.</p>

<p>For two days I carried her image in my heart.
I know not how it is with others but when I have
once decided to love a certain person I find it a
simple matter to do so. At the first glimpse of
Lady Wimpole my heart, had, so to speak, assumed
a crouching posture. It only remained
for me to tell my emotions what to do, just as I
might direct my great police dog, Graustein, to
stop a suspicious character. By now I was
thoroughly aroused. The memory of those atrocious
teeth-marks and that blemished fore-arm
were fresh fuel.</p>

<p>At exactly ten-thirty on the appointed Thursday
I approached the villa. It was close shuttered
and wore a vacant, deserted look at
which my heart sank. The gate was locked
and the bell jangled noisily among deserted rose
bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curses!&#8221; I ground out between clenched
teeth. &#8220;She was toying with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A step on the gravel interrupted my bitter reflections.
It was the old gardener.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;<i>Madame est partie</i>,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;<i>et Monsieur
aussi ... sur le yacht ... ce matin.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>A glance toward the bay confirmed his statement;
the slim white shape of Wimpole&#8217;s yacht,
the Undine, was no longer in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;But did they leave no message?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>He turned aside smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Un mot? Sais pas ... c&#8217;est-&agrave;-dire ...
peut-&ecirc;tre ...</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw what he was driving at. Damn the baksheesh
hunting tribes!</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; I said, thrusting a crisp bank-note
through the bars. Seizing it he fumbled in his
blouse and produced a large envelope which
I clutched eagerly, tearing it open as the bearer
disappeared into the depths of the garden. Beneath
the now familiar crest, in a bold masculine
handwriting, I read the simple words, &#8220;Meet me
in the desert, S. W.&#8221;</p>

<p>This thwarting of my desire, this baffling of my
purpose&mdash;was the one thing needed to set my
blood on fire. On the instant I turned and ran
down the hill toward the water-side, all thought of
Monacan courts-of-law completely forgotten. At
the precise moment when the stately judge-advocate
in his purple and green <i>laetitia</i> or official robe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
opened the Monacan Court, the little Kawa was
slipping over the Southern horizon toward the
African mountain wall beyond which lie the limitless
sands of the Sahara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me in the desert,&#8221; she had said. No
desert on earth could be big enough to hide her.
My emotions were up, and in full cry!</p>

</div>


<p>Africa! Far away I sighted the purple shadow
of the land of mystery, the low-lying coast-line
and interior wall of mountains behind which lay
the vastness of Sahara.</p>

<p>We struck the coast at Djidjelli, further East
than we had anticipated. Captain Triplett, my
navigator, said that compasses always acted queerly
in these waters which he ascribed to the influence
of occult desert powers, outraged divinities
and the like.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them genuses,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they raise hell with
yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Be that as it may we had to veer sharply in order
to make Algiers on the third day after clearing
from and out of Monte Carlo. The harbor showed
no trace of the Undine and according to the port-authorities
she had not touched there, nor was
there any record of the Wimpole party at the
leading hotels or travel bureaus. They were gone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
swallowed up in the immense folds of the silent,
brooding Southland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me in the desert!&#8221; Lady Sarah&#8217;s parting
cry rang in my ears. In it I detected the first
note of appeal suggesting her growing need of
me, a need of which she was perhaps still unconscious,
but which might grow to who knows what.
Why was I so certain she referred to Sahara, the
Great Desert? I can not say, but it seemed inevitable
that she would choose the largest; it was
in keeping with the majestic, monumental nature
of the woman. Whatever the reason I was positive
that somewhere in those uncharted wastes I
should find her. Facing them, as I stood on the
quarter-deck with Whinney, my acting-first-officer,
I pressed Lady Wimpole&#8217;s letter in my breast
pocket and whispered softly &#8220;I come, my lady of
the desert, I come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; said Whinney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221; I answered shortly and went below.</p>

<p>Another certainty, arrived at during my trans-Mediterranean
trip, loomed large in my plans.
Re-visiting the desert after an absence of ten
years I decided that I should assume my title of
Sheik of the Moplah Bedouins which had been conferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
upon me in recognition of having saved a
native caravan from certain death due to the sudden
failure of the wells at the Oasis of Sus.</p>

<p>Since that memorable time the Sheik, as an institution,
has acquired a tremendous sentimental
and romantic value which fell in admirably with
my quest of the remarkable English woman who
had yanked me so forcibly from the spiritual doldrums.</p>

<p>Tunis, Algiers, Fez and Agadir, all the important
North African towns&mdash;now do a thriving
business in Sheik-outfitting, the bazaars ringing
with the cries of costumers, burnous-boys, veiled
Circassian beauties with their trays of turbans,
dealers in arms and accoutrement, saddle-sellers
and camel merchants. But I needed none of this
shoddy material designed entirely for the tourist
trade. What I wanted was the real thing.</p>

<p>Two days after my arrival in Algiers I stumbled
on Ab-Domen Allah, the faithful dragoman who
had dragged me through Turkey and Arabia in
1902. It was sheer Traprock luck, for he was the
very man I wanted, capable, resourceful and devoted.</p>

<p>Over a glass of coffee on the terrace of the Di
Baccho I explained my needs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;<i>Si, si</i>,&#8221; he hissed, patting his huge bulk delightedly.
&#8220;I understand. I will attend to everything.
See, we had best do thus and so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dipping his fore-finger in the coffee he drew an
excellent likeness of Africa on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will enter here at Rascora on the very
western edge of the desert. You can go round by
water: I will meet you there with the camels.
Thus we will go through the desert the long way.
You will miss nothing. You are looking for
something, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated, but he burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman! Aha, my friend. You have not
changed since I met you in Skutari! You devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing back from the table in order to give
himself room to shake he trembled like a mountain
of jelly until a glance at his wrist-watch told him
it was the evening hour for worship. He could
not kneel but turned his chair toward Mecca and
performed the orthodox calisthenics in a sketchy
but satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Personally I was more than willing to let him
have his laugh in exchange for having secured his
services. Matters of detail could now be dismissed.
At dawn the next day I weighed anchor for
Tangier and points west, slipping rapidly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the Moroccan coast with short stops at Mogador,
Rio de Oro and, finally, Rascora.</p>

<p>Rapid though the trip was it took the better
part of a fortnight allowing Ab-Domen no more
than time to assemble our caravan. During the
interval I took up the re-study of the desert languages,
Berber, Arabic, Bedouin and the main Sudanese
dialects all of which I had fairly well
mastered before we rounded the gleaming cliffs
of Cape Blanco. I also gave considerable time to
exercising myself in the florid style of speech without
which no Sheik is really a Sheik. During these
periods of study I would stand near the capstan and
apostrophize my lost lady in the most poetic terms.</p>

<p>&#8220;O thou! beautiful as the dawn and rounded as
the bursting lotus-bud whose voice is as the cooing
of a dove calling gently to its mate, lo, from afar I
come to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>These proceedings astonished the crew. In fact
I overheard Captain Triplett say to Whinney,
&#8220;The old man is cuckoo,&#8221; to which the flippant
first-officer replied, &#8220;You gushed a geyser.&#8221; I
had to reprimand them both severely.</p>

<p>Another exercise to which I devoted considerable
time was the practising of that stern, aloof
mien which is the proper Sheik-ish attitude. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
was very hard for me for my nature is genial.
However no one ever heard of anyone clapping
one of these portentous Arabs on the shoulder with
a &#8220;Hello, Sheik; how&#8217;s tricks.&#8221; That sort of
thing would mean death according to modern
literary standards and I endeavored to convey this
idea to my companions whenever they were familiar
which was always. I almost precipitated a row
when I said one day to Whinney, &#8220;Peace, thou
ill-begotten son of a base-born mule-driver.&#8221;...
He seized a belaying pin with the light of mayhem
in his eyes and I had great difficulty in explaining
the purely figurative meaning of my words.</p>

<p>In private, however, I continued the practise of
speeches redolent of the great eastern orators who
are pastmasters of the art of saying it with flowers,
while I also steeled my heart to a cruelty toward
all woman-kind which is an absolute prerequisite
of successful Sheik-ery. Often, in the privacy of
my cabin, I would seize my rolled-up steamer rug
by the throat and cry harshly &#8220;So, I have you at
last, have I? Remember, woman, you are mine! ...
all mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>As may be imagined these studies filled in the
time admirably and made me mad with longing for
the actual desert voyage to begin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Two days after dropping anchor Ab-Domen appeared
on the outskirts of Rascora winding his
way down from the Atlean foot-hills, bells tinkling,
flutes playing and camels smelling. He had
assembled a complete outfit equipped with everything
for an indefinite stay in the desert.</p>

<p>I had decided on camels as our motive power for
I loathe such modern contraptions as motorboats
in Venice and motor-trucks in the desert. I
couldn&#8217;t quite fancy myself as a Sheik arriving
on a truck and crying &#8220;Lo! it is I, the son of the
Eagle.&#8221; Besides I would probably get my burnous
caught in the fly-wheel which would be a pity
as it was really magnificent, a true Moplah Sheik
costume, pure white with a number of tricky gold
ornaments.</p>

<p>Ab-Domen had done a gorgeous job in selecting
my camels. During his shopping he had been
accompanied by my friend Herman Swank, for
many years my super-cargo. We stood together
as the herd wound its way into the village under its
own power and Swank gave me some interesting
information on their fine points.</p>

<p>Qualifications to be considered in buying a
camel are water-and-weight capacity, hair-crop
and stupidity. The first consideration is how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
many miles per gallon can the beast do. Curiously,
just as with automobiles, dealers invariably lie
about this point.</p>

<p>Weight-capacity is tested by loading the camel
until he can&#8217;t get up and then removing small
amounts until he <i>just</i> can, thus giving the traffic
all that it can possibly bear.</p>

<p>The hair-crop of the camel is one of the staple
harvests of the desert area and is of tremendous
value for the local manufacture of ropes, shawls,
blankets, etc., and for the export trade in camels-hair
brushes, used the world over by water-color
artists. Water colors are, of course, out of the
question in the Sahara where there is very little
color and almost no water.</p>

<p>Stupidity, the last named attribute, is an essential
in a good camel. Fortunately most of
them possess it to an amazing degree. Without it
no animal would think of entering the desert let
alone carrying the crushing burdens which are imposed
upon them. Ab-Domen had combed the
country for stupid camels, among which the
bactrian booby-prize went to DeLong, my own
mount. Whinney bestrode Rufus, a reddish
beast while Swank called his Clotilde in memory
of a young woman he had known in the Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Quarter. They were all single humped Arabians
which are superior to the Asiatic variety, just why
I can&#8217;t say. After having ridden them a week it
seemed impossible that they could be superior to
anything.</p>

<p>We left Triplett at Rascora whence he was to
take the Kawa round to Cairo. I allowed six
months for our trans-African trek. Two days
after his departure we faced the East in the conventional
caravan formation, led by an ass, the emblem
of good luck. Our number had been increased
by approximately sixty nomads of my own
tribe, the Moplahs, a number of minor-Sheiks and
a rabble of desert folk, Walatu-s, Gogo-s and
Humda-s. To these must be added the <i>doolahs</i>
or black camel-boys who closed the file while Ab-Domen,
on a powerful camel, held a roving commission,
darting hither and yon, or to and fro as
needed.</p>

<p>Our first objective was the Oasis of Arag-Wan.
For several days we passed through tiny desert
villages, Uskeft, Shinghit, Tejigia and others.
There was no trace of the Wimpoles, but in this
I was not disappointed. It would have been humiliating
to find her too quickly, to stumble upon
my lady on the first day out, to say &#8220;Oh, <i>there</i>
you are!&#8221; and to have the whole episode over. I
felt sure that our meeting would be more dramatic.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>On the fourth day we faced the empty desert.
Never had I felt more completely a Sheik. My
friends Swank and Whinney had caught my enthusiasm
as well as my mode of dress and address.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hail, El-Swanko!&#8221; I would say; &#8220;Son of the
well-known morn and illustrious evening-star,
may thy blessings be as the hairs on thy camel&#8217;s
head and thy bed as soft as his padded hoof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back at you, Dhubel-dhub, Sheik of the
Moplah Chapter,&#8221; my friend would cry, being a
bit unpracticed in the fine points of sheik-talk.
But he came on rapidly and was soon able to converse
fluently in the ornate hyperbole of the
country.</p>

<p>The desert and the ocean have been frequently
compared but happenings of the next few days
were to bring this comparison home in no uncertain
terms. Swank and Whinney suffered acutely
from their first experience on camel-back and
even I felt somewhat uneasy until I became accustomed
to DeLong&#8217;s pitch and roll. The
&#8220;ship-of-the-desert&#8221; is no idle poeticism.</p>

<p>Beyond Tejigia we were completely out of
sight of water. No trace of passing craft broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the horizon about us. Like an admiral at the
head of his fleet I scanned the sky anxiously.
Three days passed. On the fourth a violent head
wind forced us to tack in order to keep the sand
out of our eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning I rose to face a titanic
struggle between earth and sky. The desert was
rising. After a three-mile advance I gave the
order to heave-to. The camels were anchored fore-and-aft,
to long tent-pegs. The sand became increasingly
fluid. Low ripples running over its
face rapidly rose to waves which dashed their
stinging spray over us with the rasping hiss of a
devil&#8217;s hot breath. In the lulls I could hear the
wails of the <i>doolahs</i> and the bubbling roar of the
camels.</p>

<p>Ab-Domen fought with the resource and bravery
of a great commander. We were now all crouching
low against the blast.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw Ab-Domen point excitedly
toward the East. A gigantic tidal-wave of sand
was bearing down upon us through the murk.
Of what followed I can only give a dim impression.
I heard the parting of several anchor ropes
and the screams of the anguished beasts as they
and their riders were swept into oblivion. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
as if to administer the <i>coup-de-grace</i>, two enormous
sand-spouts loomed up from the south, hideous
spinning wraiths, whirling dervishes of the
desert, personifying all the diabolic malevolence
of this ghastly land. One missed us, passing within
a few yards of DeLong and myself; the other
moved directly across the compact mass of <i>doolahs</i>
who lay screaming in its path. I had a glimpse of
a score of black bodies sucked upward into the
swirling column, spinning helplessly in the vortex
with arms and legs out-thrust, grasping or kicking
at the empty air. Then all was dark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five hours later I dug myself out of suffocation
and sand. The storm had passed. Twelve
<i>doolahs</i> and two camels were missing. The rest
were badly disorganized. But the desert lay,
calm and peaceful about us. We had weathered
the storm and, to my infinite joy, there, in the
distance, the white walls and bending palms of an
oasis gleamed in the evening sunlight&mdash;the wells
of Arag-Wan. We had won through!</p>

<p>Still no trace of the Wimpoles. I was up early
and out betimes. We had pitched our tents and
rested our caravan in the shadow of the palms of
Arag-Wan. Here our water-skins, canteens,
camels and other containers were filled to overflowing.
A trace of French thrift surprised me.
The wells had been fenced off and equipped with
a red Bowser-pump guarded by a half-cast Berber
in brown cloak and battered visor-cap bearing
the legend &#8220;<i>Colonies d&#8217;Afrique</i>.&#8221; There was
free-air but not free-water.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Combien de gallons?</i>&#8221; asked the old chap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fill &#8217;em up,&#8221; I ordered, knowing that the next
station was hundreds of miles to the eastward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />

<p>During the filling process I wandered out into
the desert. The air was cool and delicious. A soft
breeze whispered through the palm trees in the
branches of which chattered a lavender <i>tabit</i> or
doctor-bird. Beyond the edge of oasis the low-growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
palmettos, oleanders and gun-sandarachs
dwindled to stunted prickly pears and leprous
leaved squill-vines among which I noted the fresh
tracks of several audad and a jerboa.</p>

<p>Intensely interested as I am in the secrets of
nature&#8217;s book I became completely absorbed in the
perusal of this fascinating page, or perhaps I
should say foot-note. Bending over the imprinted
tracks in silent study I became aware of a soft
tread on the sand back of me. I turned my head
silently but though I made the motion with the
greatest caution it was enough to stampede a
flock of seven magnificent whiffle-hens, birds of
the utmost rarity, a cross between the ostrich and
the bustard.</p>

<p>They were off at once, loping across the desert
with that supremely easy and deceptive swing of
their slightly bowed legs, traveling at a gait which
breaks the heart of the swiftest horse, their snowy
plumes gleaming in the sunshine. But what
brought me up all standing was the fact that the
leader of the flock sported in the center of his tail-feathers
a gorgeous ostrich plume which very evidently
did not belong there. For it was bright
blue!</p>

<p>On the instant I recognized it as the ornament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
worn by Lady Wimpole at the Casino in Monte
Carlo!</p>

<p>A second later I was rushing pell-mell back to
camp to rouse Ab-Domen and make preparations
for pursuing the rapidly vanishing whiffle-hens.</p>

<p>Fortunately my faithful dragoman had had the
foresight to include in the caravan a number of
fleet Arabian steeds for just this sort of sudden
foray or side-excursion. I selected Whinney as
my companion and we were soon mounted in the
deep, Moroccan saddles, bits and bridles jingling
with bells, burnouses flapping and long guns projecting
at dangerous angles. The animals were
frantic to be off, rearing, snorting, glaring with
blood-shot eyes and blowing foam over the grooms
who clung on madly like hounds at a fox&#8217;s throat
until I gave the word &#8220;<i>Marasa!</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Cast off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Off we flew like arrows. It would have been
more impressive had we both gone in the same direction.
As it was the effect was somewhat scattered
and it was ten minutes before Whinney and
I re-convened two miles from the encampment
and were able to lay a course in the supposed direction
of the birds. Our brutes had now calmed
down but were still mettlesome and we seemed to
fly over the sandy floor, eagerly scanning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
horizon. Fortune favored us. The flock had
stopped to feed among some low-growing ground-aloes
and we came on them suddenly in a fold of
the plain.</p>

<p>Reining up I motioned Whinney to move with
caution. We must rouse but not frighten them
if we hoped to keep within range. Cupping my
hands I gave a close approximation of the cry of
the African whimbrell, a small but savage bird
which is the bane of the whiffle-hen whom
it pesters by sudden, unexpected attacks. The
flock moved on at once looking about and paying
no attention to us as long as we remained
at a distance.</p>

<p>Thus we proceeded for the better part of the
morning. The sun&#8217;s heat was becoming dangerous.
According to all laws of desert travel we
should have been safely sheltered in our tents but
I kept on obstinately. My theory was this; whiffle-hens,
owing to the value of their plumage, are
often caught, corralled and domesticated as is the
ostrich. That this was the case with the birds we
were following was evident from the presence
among them of Lady Wimpole&#8217;s blue feather.
They might well have been part of her caravan,
have broken bounds and launched out for themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
On then, ever on! Fortune favors the obstinate!</p>

<p>As if to corroborate my thought, things began
to happen. The whiffle-hens suddenly stopped in
their tracks and stood peering forward. By moving
to one side I noticed what their mass had concealed,
namely a few palm trees and tents at no
great distance, the occupants of which had apparently
seen the birds approaching. To one
side was a temporary corral, its gate invitingly
open.</p>

<p>Sensing the psychological moment I gave the
word to Whinney and with a loud cry we sped
forward. The whiffle-hens caught by this unexpected
onslaught dashed onward, instinctively
rushing into their old quarters outside of which
we drew rein, to be praised, congratulated and
wondered at by the desert patriarch who had given
up his precious creatures as lost. Bending low he
ground his face in the earth, raising his head only
to blow out small clouds of sand&mdash;for he was of
that odd sect, the <i>Ismilli</i> or sand-blowers&mdash;mixed
with a volley of laudatory expletives.</p>

<p>It was unmistakably the Wimpoles&#8217; caravan.
Hampers, hold-alls, English-tents and impedimenta
were everywhere in evidence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Where are they, the Lords of your destiny?&#8221;
I questioned.</p>

<p>The old hen-shepherd blew out a final cloudlet
of sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is their dwelling: the silken tent neath
the third palm. They are but just now risen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dismounting and throwing my reins to the native
I strode off in the direction indicated. As I
drew near the tent I paused.</p>

<p>Voices were raised in altercation. Far be it from
me to be eaves-dropper to a private family-quarrel,
which, alas, I feared was an all too frequent
occurrence in the lives of this mismated pair.
Ready to withdraw I hesitated when a particularly
sharp interchange forced a decision. A burst
of laughter was followed by a man&#8217;s voice crying
hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;By God, I&#8217;ll cut your throat!&#8221; Then
a shriek rang out. It was high time to interfere.
A fight may be private but a murder is not.
Drawing aside the curtain I leapt into the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Stay thy hand: infidel son
of a swineherd&#8217;s sister; or by the beard of the
Prophet thou perish&#8217;st.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speech was entirely impromptu and I
thought it sounded well, but somehow it fell flat.</p>

<p>Lord Wimpole was alone. He was shaving.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;I was speakin&#8217; to that dam&#8217; parrot,&#8221; he said
brandishing his razor toward Selim who was
twisting about and making a noise like sick automobile-gears.
&#8220;Who are you, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>How low the fellow was! ... and how contemptible
he looked, his face half shaved, half
lumpy with lather. One of life&#8217;s bitter jokes is
that practically every man must shave. As I thus
philosophized the curtains of an adjoining apartment
opened and She appeared.</p>

<p>Heavens! how beautiful she looked. She <i>en
dishabille</i>, clutching about her golden body the
folds of a dazzling silk kimono, purple shot with
green. Her hair was down: being bobbed it was,
of course, always down, and her blue eyes were
filmy with sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor....&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>I checked her with an imperious gesture in
which was expressed the boundless freedom of the
fiery Arab race.</p>

<p>&#8220;El Sheik Abdullah-el-Dhub ak Moplah,&#8221; I
announced.</p>

<p>Lord Wimpole was plainly impressed. Hastily
finishing his left cheek he extended his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Oly mackerel ... a real Sheik. Put&#8217;er
there. I&#8217;m a lord meself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Ignoring his effusion I spoke solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leagues have I ridden, I and my faithful follower,
tracing the flight of birds, yea, even of the
swift-skimming whiffle-hens, which ever drew nearer
to their home even as my falcon-heart drew nearer
to its nest, the tent of the most beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at Lady Sarah who never batted an
eye though one lovely lid drooped ever so slightly.
Continuing I said, in part.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, the journey done, I am a-weary
and would fain repose myself in the light of the
gazelle&#8217;s eyes. My charger rests neath the nodding
fig-tree and my soul is parched and a-thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a craftily contrived bit. Wimpole
gaped through most of it but got the final word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirst&#8221; ... he cried. &#8220;Gad, I should say so.
Me too. Jolly good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later, her ladyship having retired,
Wimpole, Whinney and I raised tall beakers of
superb Scotch to my heartfelt toast, &#8220;the loveliest
lady in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Would she hear me? I wondered. A husky
voice from behind the curtain answered my hope:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lads, pass one in to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The afternoon, it appeared, was to be given
over to a lion hunt in spite of the objections of
Effendi-Bazam, the <i>Karawan-bashi</i> or leader of
the Wimpole party which, by the way, was as ill-organized
and amateur an outfit as I have ever
seen. We were now not far from the southern
edge of the Ahaggar Plateau which thrusts its
spurs into the desert like the stony fingers of a
giant hand clutching at the sands. The ravines
between the fingers were an ideal lurking place for
desert lions, mangy, ill-favored beasts but far more
sporty than their South African brothers.</p>

<p>Effendi-Bazam was an undersized ottoman,
hardly higher than a foot-stool. He was thoroughly
desert-broken but as timorous as a hare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great danger!&#8221; he cried, pointing northward
when the hunting expedition was proposed.
&#8220;Great danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger from what ... the lions?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head and I saw a convulsive
swallow traverse the length of his triplicate chins.
Then he motioned me aside, out of ear-shot of the
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not lions,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;but worse ... a
madder, wilder beast. O, listen, I pray, important
Sheik el-Dhub, listen and heed. We are in the
land of Azad,&mdash;Azad the Terrible. In yonder defiles
he lurks and who so ventures therein is defiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>I should mention in passing that there was no
suspicion of a pun in Effendi&#8217;s original statement
which was delivered in the Astrachan dialect: the
horrid thing is unavoidable in an honest translation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Azad!&#8221; he continued,&mdash;&#8220;you have heard of
him? Murder, blood, rapine ... they are but
beads on his rosary. O, magnificent Moplah, I
fear for our lives ... for our lady. <i>Ai! Ai!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay grovelling at my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rise, Effendi,&#8221; I ordered. &#8220;Due caution will
be exercised.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without understanding my words he departed,
comforted.</p>

<p>Azad! small wonder that at the mention of his
name my face had assumed its sternest, cruellest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
expression, for it is a name which is almost unspeakable
in the mouth of any self-respecting
desert denizen. In every story of the desert which
I have studied there is one Sheik who is described
as the cruellest man in the world. To put the
matter arithmetically, these men added together
equal one-half of Azad. That is how wicked he
was.</p>

<p>He was said to be the son of a Spanish murderer
who, having escaped from the <i>bastilliano</i> at
Cadiz, lived for a time with a gypsy woman of unknown
origin. Azad was the result. From his
earliest years he was an outlaw and defy-er of authority.
Swaggering, brawling, killing, making
love, he roamed from one Mediterranean port to
another, gathering about him a following of riff-raff
and ne&#8217;er-do-wells. Then came his notorious
abduction of Miss Sedley from the mission station
at Fez. This outrage assumed international
proportions. Our government, after a sharp interchange
of notes with France, proposed a punitive
expedition. Two months later President
Felix Faure was assassinated. Then rumors began
to leak out that Miss Sedley did not wish to
be rescued and the affair was dropped.</p>

<p>From that time the name of Azad became a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
synonym for unbridled license. Many a time I
have heard the fishermen along the Moroccan
coast say, as the thunder rolled among the coast-ranges.
&#8220;Aha; there is old Azad, laughing at the
law!&#8221;</p>

<p>If we were near Azad we were near violence,
that was certain, but you may be sure I said nothing
of this to the others since there was naught
to be gained by alarming them. I had another
and better plan. I must divert them from their
proposed expedition into the hills.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon when the sun was
beginning to lose its violence the horses were
saddled and the gun-bearers gathered under the
palm trees, Effendi meanwhile becoming more
and more anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Milady,&#8221; I said, addressing Lady Sarah who
had just come out of her dressing tent, &#8220;have you
ever hunted desert lions before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only yesterday,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but we&#8217;d no
luck. Not so much as a whisker did we see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go far enough,&#8221; put in Lord Wimpole.
&#8220;Effendi stuck about the edges of the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious ...&#8221; I mused, &#8220;that you saw no lions
... for there are plenty of them there ... and
yet....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Wot are you drivin&#8217; at?&#8221; blustered Wimpole.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t we of seen &#8217;em if they&#8217;d been there?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was just what I wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; then, as if the thought had
just occurred to me. &#8220;By jove; this is an ideal
place for netting lions!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Lord and Lady Wimpole were instantly
intrigued.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho?&#8221; they cried simultaneously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the idea,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;Over there is
typical lion country, nothing there but sand and
lions. But you can&#8217;t see them; nature takes care
of that, you know, protective coloration. Tawny,
yellowish beasts&mdash;they&#8217;re invisible at ten feet.
But they can be caught. How many camels have
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two&#8221; supplied Effendi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Take all the nets that go over their
loads and fasten them together. Quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as the Sheik says,&#8221; said Lord Wimpole.</p>

<p>An hour later we were ready, the camel nets in
a huge ball being rolled easily over the desert.
About three miles distant I had noted a rocky
flume which narrowed at its lower end. It was
ideal for my purpose. Spreading the nets below
I ran a strong camels-hair rope through the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
edges making a gathering string which was then
carried up and over the projecting rock. At my
direction a score or more of <i>doolahs</i> began prodding
the high bank of sand that rose between the
rock-walls of the gorge. First in a slow trickle,
then in a steady stream the sand slid down into the
nets. Occasionally a large mass would fall in
which I thought I detected a flurried motion but,
from our distance, I could not be sure. When
the sand had piled itself to a height of about twelve
feet, the base of the symmetrical cone reaching
to the edge of the nets I gave a word of
command, &#8220;Now!&#8221; and the <i>doolah</i>-boys began
pulling hastily at the gathering-rope. The edge
of the nets rose neatly, closing-in around the
top of the cone. Phase one of my operation was
complete.</p>

<p>Next came the final and exciting step of freeing
the nets of sand. This was accomplished by yawing
the gathering-rope violently from side to side
until the net was sufficiently loosened to allow its
being dragged across the desert floor. Twice,
thrice the sturdy <i>doolahs</i> hurled their bulks on the
rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;She starts ... she moves!&#8221; shouted Whinney.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Once in motion, the sand spun rapidly through
the meshes until it was reduced to a small mass in
the center of which I could detect two vague, but
furiously revolving forms ... lions!</p>

<p>&#8220;Spearmen, ready!&#8221; I commanded, for it does
not do to be unprepared.</p>

<p>Lord Wimpole, express-rifle in hand, was apoplectic
with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we shoot &#8217;em?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;No ... no!&#8221; I motioned him back. &#8220;They
will kill each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, after a few moments&#8217; fearful clawing
and growling the fierce struggle amid the
strong meshes quieted down. Two precautionary
shots into the net, and the battle was over. At our
feet lay the mangled remains of two tawny lions,
exactly matching the shade of the surrounding
sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;For milady&#8217;s boudoir.&#8221; I said quietly. &#8220;In
my own country we do it with a sieve; it is much
simpler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Straordinary!&#8221; said Lady Wimpole giving
me a meaning look from her brilliant eyes, and we
made our way back toward the camp voting the
affair a complete success.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>We dined in state in the Wimpoles&#8217; dining-tent.
It was a lucullan repast of European delicacies
varied with African dishes superbly cooked by a
French chef; hors d&#8217;&#339;uvres, a delicious thin soup,
audad steak and Egyptian quail succeeded each
other, each course being marked by its appropriate
wine from sherry through the whites and reds to
cognac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t bring any champagne&#8221;; apologized
Lord Wimpole through a mouthful of quail, &#8220;tried
to but it blew up. No ice in the dam&#8217; desert?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sarah looked on coldly as her husband
passed through the familiar phrases of garrulity,
incoherence and speechlessness. She rose disdainfully
just as his lordship slipped heavily from his
camp chair. &#8220;May I speak to your ladyship a moment
... alone.&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Effendi, remove his lordship.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed her out under the cool stars, whispering
to Whinney as I passed, &#8220;Get the horses
ready, we must away.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the edge of the oasis Lady Sarah paused and
faced me. We were alone&mdash;at last! Overhead a
million eyes looked down from the twinkling gallery
of heaven; far to the west a gibbous moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
shone palely; night enveloped us&mdash;in fact it
was going on midnight. Clearing my throat I
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;O woman, strange and mysterious, lamp of my
life, it is not for me to rend the veil of thy secrecy,
but my soul is eager in its questioning and my heart
cries for an answer. Tell me, if thou so will&#8217;st, why
did&#8217;st thou fly from thy nest when thou had&#8217;st
made tryst with me at the police-station?&#8221;</p>

<p>To my delight she caught the elevation of my
style at once and replied unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, O desert-man, Sheik Adullah-el-Dhub,
and let thy heart attend, for oft has my own voice
upbraided me that I did thus walk out on thee.
Know then that it was not my will but that of the
Sheik Wimpole, my over-lord, that hurried me
hither-ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though I winced at the reference to her over-lord
I could but admire her fluent mastery of the
nomadic tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;He it was,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;who plucked me
from thy side, fearing the long delays of the law.
But thou gottest my message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, Princess&mdash;&#8221; I answered, at which she
smiled, pleased evidently, at the promotion,&mdash;&#8220;Yea,
even so,&mdash;and thy signal plume likewise. &#8217;Twas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
well contrived the matter of the whiffle-hens. Trust
thy woman&#8217;s wit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas simple,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;They were in
the keeping of Kashgi, the sand-blower, an ancient
stupid. Under guise of petting the bell hen I affixed
my feather. Something told me they would
find you, O Great South-wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words moved me deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight as the thrown lance or the sped arrow,&#8221;
I cried, feeling that the moment for tender mastery
had come, &#8220;so came thy harbinger to me, O woman
of bronze and gold. Allah be praised, whose hand
hath guided me since that first fair evening when
at the ocean&#8217;s edge I marvelled at thy sky-line!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down at me, for she was slightly taller
than I&mdash;tenderly, her rugged contours softened
and beautified in the silver light. It was like moonlight
on a cliff. My heart pounded furiously&mdash;her
presence, the silence of the desert ... the cognac....
I was fired by emotion. Drawing myself
up to her full height I stretched out my arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>On the instant I paused, thunderstruck. Far
away on the northern horizon a light gleamed for a
moment and was gone. Was it fact or fancy that
made me think I saw a vague shape in the shadows
before me. Instantly the thought of Azad flashed
through my mind and brought me to my senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Lady Sarah,&#8221; I said hurriedly&mdash;&#8220;I must defer
what I was going to say until another time.
I was forgetting what made me ask for this
interview&mdash;the night&mdash;your beauty&mdash;but the point
is this. You, we, all of us are in imminent
danger. On the hills yonder lies the camp
of Azad the Terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could see her pale in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even now his spies are probably prowling
about, watching your camp, counting your men,
your camels, your&mdash;women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you suggest?&#8221; she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flight&mdash;&#8221; I replied boldly.</p>

<p>Her glance expressed both surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I repeated harshly, &#8220;flight! I have never
been afraid to be cautious. Listen, Lady Sarah.
Your caravan is ill-equipped. Effendi is strong on
commissary but weak on munitions. There is but
one thing to be done. We must consolidate. Azad
will not attack tonight; he knows I am here. At
dawn strike camp and remove to the Southward.
In the meantime I will speed to my own men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
summon them to your assistance. There is not a
moment to be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hastily retracing our steps we reached the
camp where, at the portal of the luxurious tent, I
bent over Lady Sarah&#8217;s hand, lightly brushing her
firm knuckles with my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell,&#8221; I breathed. &#8220;Remember, strike
camp at dawn. Be of good heart&mdash;and do not forget&mdash;the
Sheik Abdullah-el-Dhub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I?&#8221; she whispered, smiling strangely.</p>

<p>As she lifted the tent curtain I had a glimpse of
the elaborate interior, hung with silken draperies
and furnished with many-hued cushions and a broad
low divan over the edge of which, upside down,
hung the brutish face of Sir Horace Wimpole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her over-lord!&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ugh! A shudder of revulsion shook me.</p>

<p>A moment later Whinney and I were rushing
through the night like great white birds while in my
heart echoed the words of an old Persian love
song&mdash;</p>

<p>
&#8220;Farewell, farewell, my sweet gazelle,<br />
With ruby eyes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;<br />

<p>Whinney and I were facing a difficult task, a
hard ride at night just when we should have been
going to bed. This meant little to me for I have
frequently gone two and three nights without sleep
but it was torture to my companion who is that
most pathetic of human beings, a creature of
regular habits. Twice, as we plodded along, he
lunged from his saddle and as I lifted him he kept
murmuring &#8220;Must have my eight hours ... must
have my eight hours.&#8221; All efforts to keep him
awake were in vain and I began to despair of ever
reaching our destination until I hit on the idea of
fastening my burnous between our horses forming
a cradle into which my friend fell with a pleased
smile and the drowsy comment &#8220;Make up lower
seven!&#8221;</p>

<p>On, on we sped at a smooth, steady pace. Now
and again the horses would separate to avoid a
thorny squill-bush and Whinney would be tossed
lightly in his blanket; but he slept soundly through
it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>I was glad to be alone, alone with my fears, my
anxieties and my great love, for that Lady Sarah
felt the force of my flaming passion I could not
doubt. Had she not called me to her side? Had
she not looked into my eyes that very evening with
an expression which might have led me to the
gates of Paradise, had I not been interrupted by
Azad&#8217;s signal flash?</p>

<p>Azad! The thought of him was a knife in my
heart. &#8220;On, Thunderer, on.&#8221; I urged my willing
horse, patting his wet neck and shoulder. Then
moved by a sentimental desire for a confidant I
leaned forward. The brute seemed to understand
for he bent back an attentive ear. &#8220;It is for her!&#8221;
I whispered. Thunderer whirled instantly and
Whinney was thrown far into the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not <i>to</i> her ... <i>for</i> her, you idiot!&#8221; I ground
out, savagely tugging at the reins and forcing my
brace of beasts back toward our passenger. But
though we were soon under way again the horses
were now restive and difficult to manage.</p>

<p>I had been steering a course by the stars, aiming
at a particularly large, red one which looked
familiar and which, Whinney agreed, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
directly over our camp. But there must have been
something wrong with my calculations. Most
Sheiks steer entirely by the heavenly bodies
but I had hardly had time to get the hang of
them.</p>

<p>The sky was fading to a delicate beryl-green
when I decided to let the horses have their own
way. As I loosed my rein they turned gracefully
at a right angle and broke into an encouraging gallop.
Soon the heavens were flooded with the invading
light, the stars paled and the sun&#8217;s rays shot
across the desert. With the sun just peering over
the horizon every stunted shrub cast a long blue
shadow, every shallow depression became a pool of
liquid purple into which Thunderer and his fellow
rushed, loose-reined.</p>

<p>We must have ridden a dozen miles out of our
way following the red star line and I was beginning
to wonder if the intelligence of the Arab
horses was all that it was said to be, when I detected
a distant something on the horizon. It was
still too far off for identification but I scanned it
eagerly. A quarter hour passed and I could clearly
make out an oasis and beneath it tents&mdash;our tents!</p>

<p>&#8220;Time to get up,&#8221; I yelled, bringing the two
horses close together, thus squeezing Whinney&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
head gently between their bellies, causing him to
open his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There we are,&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Get up, man; climb
into your saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He clumsily obeyed my injunction and having
freed my burnous, I gave Thunderer his head and
dashed forward, glad to be temporarily rid of my
sleepy companion. As I flashed by I had a glimpse
of Whinney checking his horse and stopping to
wipe the sleep from his eyes. Little did I realize
it at the time but my leaving him at that moment
was to be one of the determining events of my life,
an event without which that life would inevitably
have been lost and this story, horrible to think of!&mdash;never
written.</p>

<p>Thunderer and I covered the last quarter mile
in record time, jumped a series of tent-ropes and
recumbent camels and bounded into the center of a
somnolent compound.</p>

<p>&#8220;To arms! To arms!&#8221; I shouted, brandishing
my own. &#8220;Your queen is in danger.&#8221; Unconsciously
I quoted the beautiful lines from the Black
Crook, probably the most exquisite lyric drama in
the English language. At my words startled Arabs
popped from the encircling tents or raised themselves
from the masses of baggage upon which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
had been sleeping. In a moment I was closely
hemmed in by a circle of swart, savage faces.
&#8220;Heavens,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;how could Ab-Domen have
recruited such tough travelling companions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, raising my hands, I addressed them, speaking
boldly, fiercely, talking down to them as it were
in order to let them know their place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearken, O, Scum of the Sahara, and hear the
words of your master, Abdullah-el-Dhub....&#8221;</p>

<p>A roar of laughter and a mighty cry of &#8220;Yaa
... a ... ah&#8221; greeted my ears and with a sickening
sense of defeat I realized that I was surrounded
by enemies. I might have known! The men were
of a different type from any of my camp-followers.
My Arabs were swart but these were swarter. I
instinctively looked over their heads to warn Whinney
of my predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back,&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Back,&mdash;I am captured.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I might have saved my breath. The plucky
fellow was already a speck on the horizon having
fled the instant he saw and heard what was transpiring.
There was only one desperate chance left;
to jump the encircling crowd. Spurring Thunderer
with both heels, I gave him a loose rein. Gathering
himself together he made a glorious leap from
a standing position high over the head of the tallest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Arab. For a second I thought I had broken
through when, straight and sure, rose a native spear
hurled by a gigantic Bassikunu. It struck my
courageous beast directly below me and with a
scream of anguish he fell on the stout shaft, the
point being forced upward through bone, sinew,
entrails, saddle-blanket and saddle. Only the
greatest nimbleness on my part saved me from a
fatal puncture.</p>

<p>Like a soaring bird I leaped from the saddle, my
burnous floating in billows about me as I planed
earthward there to be seized by a hundred hands,
disarmed, my hands trussed behind me, my feet
bound in morocco leather and my head covered with
a filthy gunny-sack.</p>

<p>About me I heard coarse laughter and an occasional
remark in the crude Bassikunu dialect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said one, kicking me contemptuously,
&#8220;this will be a pleasant surprise for Azad.&#8221;</p>

<p>So? I was in <i>his</i> hands. O, the bitterness of my
reflection that Azad, the cruellest of men, held me
thus in his power, and that far from having captured
me I, Traprock, had deliberately ridden into
his arms. The humiliation, the ignominy of it. By
a desperate movement I managed to struggle to my
feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Bound as I was, with my head covered I must
have presented the appearance of a contestant in
some grotesque gymkhana event. After a few convulsive
leaps I fell heavily, landing in the live
embers of the cook&#8217;s fire over which hung a kettle
of some nauseous brew which I promptly upset in
my spasmodic efforts to escape the burning brands;
all this to the accompaniment of uproarious laughter.</p>

<p>Rolling over in one final wriggle I felt something
hard under my hands back of me. My grasp
tightened on it by instinct as I lost consciousness
from faintness and suffocation. I knew vaguely
that I was being lifted by two men after which I
was thrown down heavily; then blackness closed
about me. Matters were not looking their best.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My first impressions of Azad were gained from
his voice. He had returned to his camp during my
fainting spell and stood not far from the spot where
I had been thrown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you get the women?&#8221; asked one of his
followers.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By her side was a mighty Sheik&mdash;a
Moplah&mdash;so my spy tells me, a man of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
strength and cunning. I resolved to bide my time.
Tonight she will be alone with her half-witted husband
and her idiot of a Karawan-bashi and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say a Moplah chief was with her?&#8221; questioned
an unfortunate follower who had not learned
the penalty of speaking out of turn in a conversation
with Azad; &#8220;why this very day....&#8221;</p>

<p>He got no further. Azad gave an almost inaudible
command at which the interrupting voice suddenly
thinned to a wheeze as if the wind-pipe had
been closed by violent pressure. A convulsive
gurgling sob was followed by a low moan and I
felt the impact of a body falling heavily on the sand
near me.</p>

<p>Though I could see nothing I must confess that
Azad&#8217;s voice was the most unpleasant I have ever
heard. Far from being harsh and dominating it
was low, cool, almost tired. It faded away at the
end of sentences as if the possessor had withdrawn
himself from human contact. I sensed the presence
of one to whom human life, even his own&mdash;was
nothing. If a snake had a voice I feel sure it would
be the voice of Azad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the fellow saying?&#8221; asked those icy
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;That we have this day captured a Moplah chief,
O Sire,&#8221; was the humble reply, &#8220;even now he lies
nearby in the shelter of thy tent where he awaits
thy pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Produce,&#8221; said Azad.</p>

<p>I was lifted and borne into a brighter light. An
instant later the sack was pulled from my head. It
was a critical moment; now, if ever, was the time
for dissimulation. I must pretend that my fainting
fit still endured; upon that depended my life.
Even a man as unspeakably cruel as Azad finds
no satisfaction in torturing an unconscious enemy.
There is no pleasure in it.</p>

<p>I was not mistaken. After a brief inspecting
during which I scarcely breathed I was again flung
into the shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him wait,&#8221; said the voice of Azad,&mdash;&#8220;when
he comes to we will....&#8221;</p>

<p>I can not repeat his proposed line of action but
the mere mention of it nearly produced a real
swoon.</p>

<p>For an hour I lay motionless, thinking, thinking,
the thought drumming in my brain,&mdash;&#8220;How should
I get out of this mess?&#8221; About me the sounds of
the camp gradually quieted. The heat grew intense
and I knew that it was the middle of the day,
the time of the siesta. And then again I became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
conscious of the object which I had clutched when
I was first thrown on the ground. Turning it over
in my bound hands I realized that it was a knife,
evidently one of the cook&#8217;s utensils which I had
knocked over. To cut the bonds back of me was
difficult but I finally managed it by lying on the
edge of the knife. One by one I felt the thongs
part though I injured myself severely in the process
for as each strand of leather gave way the blade
sank in my flesh and the sand was reddened about
me.</p>

<p>Faint but desperate I realized that I must act
quickly in the brief interval offered to me. Freeing
my feet I cautiously lifted my burlap veil and
peered about. I lay near the entrance of Azad&#8217;s
tent in the recesses of which I could see his body
sunk in deep slumber, guarded by a drowsy slave.
Just beyond the outer curtain lay the form of a
humble Bassikunu, the unfortunate creature who
had interrupted his lord and master. The hem of
his dirty brown mantle almost touched that of my
burnous.</p>

<p>An open attempt to escape now meant certain
death. For one mad moment I thought of springing
to my feet, cleaver in hand, and dispatching the
filthy Azad with one clean blow. But what was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
be gained. The odds were too great. Slowly a
plan formed in my mind.</p>

<p>With the silence of a snake I edged slightly
nearer the slain Bassikunu until our garments overlapped.
It was the work of an hour which seemed
like twelve for me to move his corpse out of his
coarse garment and into the voluminous folds of
my cloak. Moving a fraction of an inch at a time,
the sweat of excitement pouring from my body, I
burrowed and pushed and pulled and hauled until
we had at last changed places, the humble camel-driver
lying inside in my Moplah cloak while I
sprawled beyond the tent wall in his blood stained
and ignoble raiment. A few feet from me on the
sand lay his tongue, plucked out by the roots, a
pretty sample of Azad&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I effected this perilous change of
costume when the camp was suddenly in an uproar.
Into the midst of the compound bounded an excited
Arab on a foam flecked horse. Azad leaped to
alertness with amazing speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak, Mulai Hadji,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their caravan approaches!&#8221; said the rider excitedly.
For a second I cherished the thought that
my own men were on the way to my rescue but
this hope died as the speaker continued, &#8220;even now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
they are moving southward,&mdash;their camels rich with
plunder, their men few and ill-armed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of the Moplah caravan?&#8221; asked Azad
who was evidently a man of caution rather than
bravery. I hung on the answer in a fever of excitement
for I knew it referred to my own expedition.
The information was delivered with a scornful
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fools! They continue Eastward in search
of their lost master. A day&#8217;s journey away they
must be nearing the Wells of Tabala. The fruit is
ripe, O Mighty Azad; the golden pomegranate is
ready for your plucking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The golden pomegranate! That could be none
other than Sarah, my lovely bird, flying southward
at my behest, straight into the clutches of this vulture,
this ... it was too much. Leaping to my
feet I ran toward the camel-compound. Happily,
in my humble costume, I was unnoticed; I was
simply a Bassikunu, one more or less. Seizing and
mounting the first available camel I joined the mob
which was surging northward. My one hope was
to detach myself from this filthy band, overtake my
own men and bring them back to the rescue. Cruel
as it seemed to desert Lady Sarah at this juncture
therein lay the only practical plan. But on a slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
moving camel my task was hopeless. Ahead of me
rode one of the sub-sheiks on a magnificent sorrel
mare. What must be done must be done quickly.
For an instant he checked his horse to avoid a tent-rope
and in that instant I acted, urging my clumsy
brute forward and riding off the Arab, pushing him
with all my force against the obstruction until horse
and rider fell sprawling. Dropping from my camel
I was at his side in a second, pretending to assist
him, in doing which I twisted his head completely
around so that though his breast lay upward his
face was buried in the sand. He fainted without a
sound and a moment later, wrapped in his great
cloak, I sprang into the empty saddle and, cautiously
at first and finally at full speed, rushed off toward
the east.</p>

<p>The whole operation took no more than three
seconds and could never have been accomplished
other than by taking advantage of the peculiar conditions
of confusion, etc., and by acting upon what
has always been my greatest safeguard&mdash;instinct.</p>

<p>Free! Free once more. With a glorious feeling
of elation I bounded off across the desert. Glancing
over my shoulder I saw that I had accomplished
my get-away without attracting attention. Azad&#8217;s
men were streaming steadily northward, a low
cloud of dust marking their progress. I watched
intently for any sign of pursuit but none came.
From the unfortunate tribesman who had ridden
my mount I feared no further trouble. The
strength of my hands is a constant surprise to me
and when I twisted the fellow&#8217;s head I had heard
something crack with the ominous, final snap of a
too-tightly wound toy. Unless I was very much
mistaken the creature was permanently out of order.</p>

<p>My hours of unconsciousness and captivity must
have been longer than I realized for I noted that
the day was far spent. This was a source of comfort
to me for hope sprang in my breast that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
sun would disappear before the treacherous scoundrel
I had evaded could come up with the Wimpole
caravan. Unconsciously I encouraged the orb of
day in his descent, urging him with prayers and
curses to sink as rapidly as possible. Sheltered by
night the cortege of my lady might yet pass a few
hours in safety, hours fraught with fiendish anxiety
for me.</p>

<p>My plans for the future hung on a gossamer
thread of chance, that of locating the Wells of
Tabala to which, according to Azad&#8217;s informant,
my faithful Moplahs had repaired. My only indication
was the vague one of direction. The wells
lay to the eastward and eastward the star of Traprock
took its way, blindly, desperately. Pray
Heaven my men would go slowly and cautiously
as they might well do considering my absence.</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s hard riding when all traces of
the enemy had faded into nothingness I paused and
from an inner pocket drew out my map of the
Sahara. As I feared it was too small in scale to
be of definite advantage. Imaginary lines such as
the Tropic of Cancer, the 20th Parallel and numerous
meridians were shown with perfect distinctness.
These would have served admirably had I been
going to an imaginary place but the Wells of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Tabala were of poignantly definite import and of
them there was no trace. With a sigh of resignation
I thrust the document back in its case and took
up the reins.</p>

<p>These first leagues of my journey were by no
means as uneventful as they sound. The reader
must remember that my horse and I were utter
strangers to each other. This the mare resented
with all the fire of the most pure-blooded Arabian
steed than which no animal is more difficult when
aroused. With true feminine deceptiveness she
concealed her feeling for a considerable period
during which we gathered tremendous speed. Then
suddenly, after a great leap in air, she landed
stiff-legged, stock-still in a cloud of sand. Fortunately
I had taken care to twist the Bassikunu cloak
firmly about the pommel of the saddle or all had
been lost. As it was I flew straight on over the
animal&#8217;s head, fetching up with a snap and swinging
downward violently at her feet. She immediately
reared, endeavoring to kill me with her
sharp hoofs. I now hung like a human apron under
her foaming muzzle, her eyes luckily being blinded
by the heavy folds. In a trice I threw my arms
about the thrashing knees, and, quickly slipping my
grip down to the fetlocks, crossed her fore-legs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
throwing my full strength against her shoulder as
she fell. With a whimper of defeat the gallant
beast rolled over on her side while I sat comfortably
on her head and regained my breath, thanking my
stars for the years of experience on our western
plains which now stood me in such good stead.</p>

<p>Then, unwrapping the burnous, I looked long
and steadily into the blood-shot eyes of the animal
below me. Gradually the wild gaze softened until
with a sigh of resignation the soft lids dropped and
the tense neck relaxed. As plainly as a horse could
the mare said &#8220;I surrender; you are my master.&#8221;</p>

<p>I instantly rose, taking the animal at her word
and she stood peacefully still while I tightened the
girths. From then on there was no more trouble
from that quarter.</p>

<p>If we had travelled fast before we now fairly
flew. The sorrel swung steadily on as if to make
amends for her past captiousness. By this time the
sun was below the horizon and purple shadows vast
and threatening rose from the wastes about me,
vague towers and impalpable wraiths of darkness
that loomed and fled. The low voice of the night
wind began its sobbing. Often there would come
to my ear the sound of a broken, inarticulate sentence
as if some inhuman tongue had babbled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
mysterious language: again the gray shape of a
jackal glided swiftly along the edge of my vision
or a desert rat scuttled across my path. As the
darkness deepened it became peopled with all manner
of visionary terrors and I could readily understand
and accept the myriad djinns, evil spirits and
ghosts of the misty East.</p>

<p>An hour later, as my heart sank lower, the sorrel
suddenly checked her stride, faltered and came to
a full stop. &#8220;Poor brute,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;you are
spent. It is the beginning of the end.&#8221; But as if
to contradict me she thrust out her nose and
neighed shrilly, following this by a cautious advance.
Plainly she had detected something of which
I was not aware. Sure enough, a hundred yards
farther on I caught the sound of low moaning, pitiful
but inexpressibly human and comforting in that
dark wilderness. We made our way quickly in the
direction of the sound and were soon rewarded by
seeing a vague black form against the desert grayness.
Hastily dismounting I bent over the object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity ... pity....&#8221; begged a weak voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Bending lower I saw that the speaker was a
woman, young and beautiful, her pale features
haggard to the point of exhaustion. When I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
given her a reviving draught from my emergency
flask and assured her of my friendly attitude she
outlined her pitiful story. It was another sample
of Azad&#8217;s dastardly work. She was a Circassian,
lured from the Convent-school of snake-charmers
at Timbuctoo. For a month she had been the
sheik&#8217;s favorite, then cast aside, poisoned as he
thought and left to bleach on the sands. But her
constant inoculation with the venom of her pets
had made her practically immune to the deadly
toxin and for three days she had lain helpless
&#8217;neath the furious sun, struggling to reach Tabala.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tabala!&#8221; At the word I sprang up. &#8220;Whither?&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;Tell me quickly. I go but to procure
aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not far,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;An hour&#8217;s ride,
perhaps, under yon constellation of El Whizbang.&#8221;
And with the words she lapsed into unconsciousness.
Covering her gently with my cloak I leaped
into the saddle. Bright above me glistened the
starry diadem of El Whizbang and once more the
sorrel and I thundered on through the night, our
hearts alight with courage and hope.</p>

<p>The desert woman&#8217;s direction was straight and
sure. With startling suddenness a group of tall
palms sprang into being. The neighing of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
excited mare roused muffled cries, movement, bustle
and confusion as vague tents disgorged their
startled inmates. &#8220;Swank! Whinney, Ab-Do-men!&#8221;
I shouted.</p>

<p>Answering shouts of &#8220;Traprock&#8221; pierced the
night.</p>

<p>There was no time lost in parley. A brief pause
for rest, a change of costume, a fresh mount and
with twenty picked men armed to the teeth I turned
back over a road I was not likely to forget.</p>

<p>&#8220;Westward-ho!&#8221; I shouted, heading the gallant
troop, and we thundered off to the rescue of all that
I held most dear.</p>

<p>In the short interval at our camp I had given
Ab-Domen explicit orders as to just what to do.
Twenty of the best tribesmen and all the available
horses came with me. The men were mostly Moplahs
with a few Kadas. They had long roamed
the desert and having had much experience with
tourists, were as rapacious and blood-thirsty a lot
as one could wish. In addition I had Swank and
Whinney, trusted and true, with the exact amount
of intelligence necessary to handle the turbulent
natives and no more.</p>

<p>Ab-Domen stayed with the caravan. His instructions
were to retrace his steps with the outfit
which was, of course, slow moving. He was to
make one day&#8217;s journey after which he was to pitch
camp and be prepared to welcome us back or dig
in and resist to the death should Allah so will. My
parting with the ponderous dragoman had been
unusually affecting and it was with a stern, set
countenance that I headed my impetuous band.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>For some time we rode in silence. The vault of
heaven was still black at the zenith but at its eastern
edge glowed a widening band of silver that
flickered and ran fitfully about the horizon as the
flame runs around the wick of an oil stove. I never
light my four-cylinder blue-flame without thinking
of that momentous hour. Back of us the star, El
Whizbang, sank to its usual matinal extinction, a
faithful and exemplary planet, having performed
its good deed for the night. We soon reached the
crouching form of the Circassian woman with
whom I left supplies, a loaf of bread, a goatskin of
camels-milk and several of the latest magazines
and whose location I marked for Ab-Domen&#8217;s
guidance with a small red flag mounted on a spear.
Thus we left her, looking like the eighteenth green
of a desert golf course.</p>

<p>In the growing light the trained eyes of my
Moplahs easily followed the vague tracks of my
previous ride. No wind had risen to disturb the
shifting sands and though invisible to me their
practised vision easily picked up the trail. They
were much puzzled when we reached the site of my
struggle with the sorrel where the deep hoof marks
and trampled sand were plain to all. &#8220;You fell?&#8221;
asked Ouidja, a cadaverous Kada. I laughed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the idea and shortly narrated the incident to their
great delight, and ejaculations of &#8220;<i>Bishmillah!</i>&#8221;
&#8220;<i>Biskra!</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Wahully!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Day now streamed lucidly over the undulating
plain but though the tension of the previous hours
was somewhat relaxed by action the increasing light
brought to me an increase of anxiety. By now
Azad&#8217;s camp would be astir. At this very moment
the attack might be beginning if&mdash;alas! it had not
already ended. This despairful thought prompted
an attempt on my part to shorten the distance between
us.</p>

<p>Between our present position and the original
site of Azad&#8217;s camp lay an hour&#8217;s hard riding.
From that point he had gone north while my course
had been east. We had been describing two sides
of a right angle. Obviously the intelligent thing to
do was to close the triangle and take the shortest
possible route along its hypotenuse. &#8220;Halt!&#8221; I ordered.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>
<p class="caption">THE RESCUE<br />

&#8220;Superb! you are like a swift-running tide-race foaming over a

<p class="caption">The Rescue</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Hastily dismounting I drew an accurate diagram
on the desert, which is ideally adapted for
geometric study. All my life long I have clung to
the knowledge that the square of the hypotenuse
is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two
sides. It stood me in good stead now. Quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
figuring the approximate distance which Azad and
I must have travelled I leaped into the saddle with
a cry of &#8220;Q.E.D.&#8221; to the mystification of my followers.
From now on I was leader indeed. According
to my figures and time allowance the distance
to be travelled should be about nineteen miles
which, with our superb animals, we could expect
to travel in a little more than an hour. &#8220;Pray
Heaven Euclid was right,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>The sun had cleared the horizon and struck
brightly on our flowing cloaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wonderful sight!&#8221; cried Swank, who
had ridden off at a distance to take a photograph.
&#8220;Superb! You are like a swift-running tide-race
foaming over a hidden reef!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was oblivious to his poetic similes for, far
off but dead ahead, I seemed to see an answering
gleam of white and a faint dusty blur on the horizon.
My heart stood still as my horse bounded forward
more swiftly than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;On!&#8221; I shouted hoarsely. The others caught
the infection of my excitement and we thundered
onward.</p>

<p>Yes! ... it was Azad and his assassins!</p>

<p>After an interminable half-hour we could see
them plainly. The attack was on in all its fury. Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
evidently Azad&#8217;s men had seen our approach, even
as we had detected them, and had thrown themselves
on their quarry with the idea of having that
part of the job done with before we could come
up. But they had reckoned without the intelligence
and courage of Lady Wimpole and the brute obstinacy
of her husband. Wimpole, it appeared
later, the instant he suspected the hostile intentions
of Azad&#8217;s party, had formed his group into a British
square which he considered absolutely unbreakable.</p>

<p>We could see the huddled formation in the center
with the encircling cordon of Bassikunus galloping
about it. The sight of a merry-go-round invariably
brings back that tragic picture. Soon we
heard the fierce cries of &#8220;<i>Blida! Laghouat blida!</i>&#8221;
a Bassikunu form of unprintable torture which
clearly accounted for the desperate resistance of
Effendi and his men. Poor Effendi! I had feared
he would give up at the first shot, but I did him
an injustice.</p>

<p>Now we were only a half-mile away but O, what
dire things can happen in a half-mile. How I
cursed the desert for its magnificent distances as I
urged my horse forward. An occasional shot, a
scream, an imprecation now mingled with the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
dust. At intervals twos and threes of the attacking
party broke from the circle, darted forward and
plucked some screeching fragment from the human
wall. A camel dashed by me, bellowing piteously,
the upper third of his hump cut cleanly off by some
terrific sabre-swing which gave him the singular
look of a table topped mountain. Brick by brick,
stone by stone, life by life, the living parapet was
being torn away.</p>

<p>Now in the center I could see the little group of
defenders, smoking revolvers in hand, Effendi-Bazam
crouching low, praying and firing simultaneously,
Lord Wimpole, white as paper, Lady
Sarah&mdash;my Sarah! redder than ever; a flaming
beacon of courage, her bottle-green veil flying behind
her and her eyes snapping behind her dark-blue
glasses. Horrors! The square had crumbled!&mdash;the
wall was down.</p>

<p>With a loud cry of &#8220;<i>Blida!</i>&#8221; the desert-scum rose
like a tidal-wave overcoming the gallant group in
a final heart-rending crash. A cloud of dust,
pierced by wails of agony, obscured the ghastly details
of the picture.</p>

<p>At times like this one does not think clearly; one
acts. It was so in this instance. Without a word
being spoken Swank and Whinney ranged themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
on either side of me, my Moplahs forming a
dense triangle at our backs. The enemy had instantly
whirled about presenting everywhere a
front bristling with guns, lances and gleaming
<i>simlas</i>&mdash;the long, curved desert-swords. With increasing
speed we hurled ourselves at the mass.
Representing as I did what efficiency experts call
the &#8220;point of contact&#8221; my position was one of extreme
danger.</p>

<p>Let me but dispose of the first man! He was a
gigantic fellow with a gun approximately twelve
feet long pointed directly at me. As he pressed his
finger to the trigger my automatic barked and he
crumpled up with a blue-edged hole in his forehead.
The next instant our crushing wedge split Azad&#8217;s
warriors into fragments. In that first moment of
terrific impact Swank and Whinney stood by me
nobly. Only men trained in the rush-hour tactics
of civilized subways could have come through alive.</p>

<p>With the first penetration accomplished it was a
case of hand to hand fighting. Everywhere were
struggling knots of humanity, swaying, plunging,
stabbing, slicing ... it was hell let loose. A single
thought in mind, I searched frantically for Lady
Sarah. She was nowhere to be seen. Weaving my
way between sprawling groups I fought toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
edge of the battle. Then I saw the devilish Azad&#8217;s
scheme, for at a distance of a hundred yards were
two horsemen, a muffled figure between them, galloping
furiously to the southward. Crafty villain!
under cover of the fighting his idea was to
escape.</p>

<p>Free of all obstacles I sped after them, rapidly
gaining on their encumbered progress. It was two
to one but what cared I. Seeing themselves overtaken
they reined up while Azad&#8217;s bodyguard took
deliberate aim through the sights of his long gun.
I could almost feel its cold muzzle on my brow.
But they had reckoned without the power of the
woman they carried. With a convulsive spring she
threw herself about the marksman and his bullet
whistled over my head; a second later he fell
pierced by the last ball from my automatic which
I flung into the sand. In a flash I was alongside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Azad,&#8221; I shrieked&mdash;&#8220;your hour has come!&#8221;</p>

<p>His usually calm face was twisted with evil passion,
not unmixed with terror. Without the help
of his henchmen the weight of the English woman
had been too much for him and I saw her huddled
body slip from his grasp and fall heavily to the
sands. He pulled savagely at his beast&#8217;s mouth
with the evident intention of backing and trampling
her to death. But at that second I resorted to an
old Moplah trick which is the pride of our tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>At a distance of ten feet I pointed the muzzle
of my gun into the sand and using it as a vaulting
pole described an arc in the air. Even so I should
have been severely if not fatally wounded for the
low-lived creature was alertly awaiting my descent
to meet me with an inescapable blow of his razor
edged <i>simla</i>.... I say &#8220;inescapable&#8221; for who can
dodge in the air? But wait.... At the very
second when by all the laws of gravitation I should
fall against the sweeping blade, at the very instant
when the wiry desert pirate delivered what
he meant should be my death blow ... I pressed
the trigger of my gun and fired it into the sand.
The recoil of these Arab weapons is enormous.
For an appreciable time my flight was not only arrested
but reversed.</p>

<p>Bird-like I leaped lightly clear of the whirring
blade only to fall with a crash on the baffled nomad&#8217;s
head, enveloping him in my burnous under
the folds of which I dragged him to the ground.</p>

<p>It was now a Sheik to Sheik contest; in-fighting
of the most inward character.</p>

<p>Fighting in a burnous is very much like fighting
under the bed clothes, a pastime in which I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
often indulged during my school-boy days. Moreover
I was master of numerous grips and holds
which are not in the Arab vocabulary. But Azad
was at grips with death and knew it; in addition I
felt sure that he still had his pistol which, if he could
but press it against my side, would be unfortunate.</p>

<p>His wiry strength surprised me. He constantly
slipped from my grasp. It was like fighting a
basket of eels in a clothes-hamper. Hither and
yon we thrashed. Once I got a grip on his Adam&#8217;s
apple and thought to have wrenched it from his
throat but his teeth closed on my ear lobe and I
loosened my hold. Now I heard the thud of horses&#8217;
hoofs, footsteps and approaching voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Club him! Club him!&#8221; shouted some one.</p>

<p>But the rescuing party were in a dilemma.
They could not tell which of the struggling forms
to club. Resolved not to let go of my enemy, with
my brain reeling and the blood pounding in my
temples I decided on a desperate expedient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Club us both,&#8221; I shouted with my last ounce of
breath.</p>

<p>A heavy blow sounded and the figure in my arms
relaxed. Before I could cry &#8220;Hold!&#8221; a second
blow fell. A white light blazed before my eyes and
I knew no more.</p>

<p>They told me afterward that I lay unconscious,
hovering twixt life and death, for four days. On
the fifth my temperature rose and I was seized by
a delirium in which I babbled of early days, my
boyhood in Derby, travels, dangers, women ...
I know not all I said. But paramount in my
thoughts was Lady Sarah whose name I called at
intervals. Prior to coming up with Azad&#8217;s men I
had not slept for seventy-two hours. I had ridden
scores of miles, been wounded a dozen times and
suffered from the keenest anxiety. The final blow
on the head, added for good measure, had been the
death of one less virile. But my will-to-live won
out.</p>

<p>On the fifth day I slowly opened my eyes and
gazed, mystified at the vision above me. It was
Lady Sarah&#8217;s face but through my filmy pupils it
loomed vague and indefinite like the harvest moon
in a fog. Then my vision cleared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;You?&#8221; I questioned.</p>

<p>She smiled and placed a finger on her lips with
the familiar nurse&#8217;s gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh ... you must not talk.&#8221; She wore the conventional
nursing costume in which all women look
well. As she turned to busy herself professionally
with a tray of medicine bottles a mounting tide of
color suffused her cheeks spreading to the ears and
neck until they were a rich mahogany. Blessed
creature! She too had suffered during her vigil.
At the thought I had an absurd vision of one of
Giorgione&#8217;s red angels bending over me. A weak
laugh faltered on my lips. She was at my side in
an instant, bottle in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time for meddy ... then go bye-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She poured out a moderate portion of something
potent and pre-war. I sank back with a sigh of
satisfaction. How good she was to me! and how
gentle!... &#8220;Meddy&#8221; &#8220;Bye-bye&#8221; &#8220;Good-night,
Nurse.&#8221; I was asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How delightful are convalescent days. The
mind is so keen and every stage of improvement
brings such a thrill of adventure from the first bit
of solid food to sitting up, being read to, talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and the bliss of the first cigarette. Then later came
visits from friends, dainties sent in and the gradual
putting-together of the past. Flowers, too&mdash;a vase
of purple bugloss-blossoms from Effendi-Bazam.
He too had been struck down and barely rescued
just as two Bassikuni were about to carry out their
threat of <i>laghouat blida</i>. I wept like a child at his
tenderness.</p>

<p>Lord Wimpole&#8217;s tent had been turned into a
sick room while he occupied mine. I do not think
he liked the arrangement but Lady Sarah had
taken these matters into her own hands. Little by
little the story was told me, of how my men had
turned the tide of battle and annihilated all but a
handful of Azad&#8217;s forces who had fled into the
desert. Seeing my grievous state a messenger was
sent to Ab-Domen which resulted in the consolidation
of the two caravans.</p>

<p>&#8220;How fortunate you arrived just when you did!&#8221;
exclaimed Lady Sarah one evening, clasping her
knees in her long bony hands. &#8220;Another second
would have been too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; blustered Lord Wimpole pulling
his stubby moustache, &#8220;we should &#8217;ave stood &#8217;em
off. You can&#8217;t break a British Square y&#8217;know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My eye,&#8221; said his wife coldly, flicking a cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
ash in his direction. &#8220;They were all over us and
you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wimpole mooned out of the tent while I was
telling his lady of my fortunate application of the
&#8220;pons asinorum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;My French is
atrocious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old geometric theorem; the bridge of asses
over which every school donkey must pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you did!&#8221; she enthused. &#8220;How clearly it
brings home the advantage of a college education.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus we passed long hours in tender confidence
during which I told her many things, she listening
for the most part, as I recounted my life from its
infancy, with a nursery anecdote here and there,
some droll saying or madcap prank which I played
on Miss Stafford, my first teacher. No detail
seemed too slight to interest this wonderful creature
to whom I vowed to bare my whole existence.
Step by step I worked my way through infancy to
adolescence, boyish sports, my skill at mumblety-peg,
my first affair with Norah Flaherty who
worked in the melodeon factory....</p>

<p>It was at the close of this tender incident that
she bent over me late one evening to tuck me in,
her rose-rimmed eyes glowing into mine. Involuntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
my arm encircled her gaunt framework
drawing her down, close ... close. Thus she
knelt by my cot for a long moment before she rose
with an effort at self mastery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you can get up tomorrow,&#8221; she murmured,
and the curtains swished softly on the night
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to Azad?&#8221; I asked one day.</p>

<p>Whinney, who was visiting me, flicked an ash
from his cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your men claimed him after he came to. They
buried him, Moplah style, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could see the wretched creature hands and feet
bound, planted up to his neck in hard-packed sand.
The eyes invariably went first, toothsome morsels
for the vultures,&mdash;then came the ants and flies.</p>

<p>&#8220;We kept him alive as long as we could,&#8221; said
my friend, &#8220;occasionally that Circassian girl used to
go out and sprinkle salt and sand on his sore spots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all for today,&#8221; I remarked, for I
was still weak.</p>

<p>It was a matter of ten days before I began to
feel my full strength and resilience returning, days
of short walks and long rests in a shaded <i>chaise-longue</i>.
Whinney and Swank had laid out an excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
nine-hole golf course where I was soon able
to join them. Golf in the desert is a simple affair,
the course being entirely of sand one needs but two
clubs, a driver and a niblick. It is like playing in
a gigantic bunker and my game soon came back to
me. Then there were afternoons of gazelle and
gecko hunting with sloughi-hounds, the only dogs
which can stand the peculiar conditions of the
desert for which nature has equipped them with
bushy, protective eye-brows, short beards and curiously
splay-toed feet which give them great speed
over soft sand. Another pastime of our leisure
hours was the Arab&#8217;s favorite pursuit of hawking.</p>

<p>No standard Sheik travels without his hawk or
hawks, hung in gay cages from their pack camels
and the women folk are constantly busy knitting
hoods for the poor creatures who spend so much of
their time blindfolded. The reason for this constant
blindfolding I had never fully understood
until Ab-Domen explained it. The theory is that
a hawk&#8217;s eye is only capable of just so much looking
and it would therefore be supremely unwise to
let him wear his eyes out in the contemplation of
useless objects such as people and camels. Now,
however, was the hawks&#8217; holiday and the air was
specked with the graceful creatures careering at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
dizzy heights like motes in a sunbeam. They are recalled
by a whistle which they obey with the marvellous
intelligence of a day laborer at the noon hour,
dropping whatever work they may be engaged in
to settle quietly on their masters&#8217; wrists.</p>

<p>An exception to this statement must be made in
the case of a hawk in pursuit of an <i>opapa</i>, a desert
fowl closely akin to the Australian carpenter-bird
which it resembles in its hammer-head, saw-bill and
long, nail-like claws. Many a morning in the Cowba
district (East of Sydney) I have been awakened
by the building operations of these creatures whose
nests are solidly framed of gum-wood which is later
stuccoed with a mixture of bird-lime and feathers.
But I digress....</p>

<p>The <i>opapa</i> of which I started to speak is for some
reason unknown to ornithology the deadly enemy
of the hawk and once sighted is the object of a relentless
attack. Seated one day in the encampment
I witnessed a grewsome battle between two of these
implacable rivals of the air. The recall had been
sounded, but the hawk paid no attention to it. His
one thought was the complete annihilation of his antagonist
which he accomplished by repeated attacks,
closing-in, ripping-off tender strips of flesh
and actually devouring the entire carcass save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the saw-bill, bony hammer-head and nails; in other
words, the hawk, in mid-air ate the artisan and
dropped only the tools, after which he returned
peaceably to his master.</p>

<p>But our position in the camp was becoming increasingly
difficult. Our water supply had been
thrice replenished from the Tabala station which
was at an inconvenient distance. Moreover the
guardian of the wells began to protest against our
frequent calls. &#8220;Caravans come and caravans depart,
but you are repeaters,&#8221; he said in effect. My
strength now was completely restored; under my
folding burnous I could feel the steel contours of
hardening biceps, triceps and forceps. Will-power,
ambition, the old love of adventure were again in
the ascendant.</p>

<p>Now arose a difficulty which was destined to result
in vital consequences. I refer to the division
of responsibility between Lord Wimpole and myself.
Here were two caravans each with an acknowledged
leader. During my illness the supreme
command had fallen in the Englishman&#8217;s hands.
Incompetent though he was he could not bring
himself to relinquish it. Temporary power had
gone to the little lace-maker&#8217;s head and the inevitable
battle of wills began. The first open break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
occurred during a discussion as to future plans.
Wimpole was all for a continuation of the life of
ease and luxury which so well suited him. His
absurd suggestion was an immediate removal to
Tabala with an indefinite stay there. My decision
was to push on to the beckoning East according to
my original plans. In vain we argued. &#8220;Very
well, we split,&#8221; said his lordship, his brow like
thunder, his lower lip protruding like a camel&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The thought of leaving Lady Sarah was unbearable.
Nevertheless with a heavy heart I resolved on
the sacrifice, ordering Ab-Domen to make preparations
for our departure. But an incident occurred
which modified this laudable design.</p>

<p>Wimpole, since his re-establishment in his own
tent, had reverted to his old manner of brawling
domesticity. Sounds of strife resounded nightly
from their quarters, the grumbling of his heavy
voice, rising to imprecation, the crash of china and
an occasional cry of protest from his unfortunate
wife. Nevertheless, as far as I knew, he had not resorted
to open violence. Pained and apprehensive
I continued my preparations. Daily the <i>doolahs</i>
trotted to and fro busily loading the camel-packs
and striking all but the necessary tents. The eve
of our separation arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The Wimpoles gave a dinner in their luxurious
dining-tent. I sat on Lady Sarah&#8217;s right, her
husband being at the other end of the table. It
was a mournful feast. My heart was too full for
food but I quaffed the succession of vintage wines
with reckless abandon. Our last evening together!
At the thought my hand stole neath the napery to
be met by that of my loved-one which awaited me
as a bird awaits its mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up Jenkins!&#8221; cried Swank gaily. I crushed
him with a look. But my caution was useless. At
his end of the table Lord Wimpole was already far
gone in drink. He was playing a harmonica, his
favorite pastime when thus afflicted. Back of his
chair Effendi patiently awaited his final collapse.
His mental attitude was particularly quarrelsome
and as the libations gained their mastery he became
more and more provocative until Lady Wimpole
rose with a sigh and moved toward the tent
entrance. There she turned and her lips silently
framed the words &#8220;Follow me,&#8221; a command I
was able to obey almost instantly as my host was
engaged in an interminable story which he had told
twice before.</p>

<p>Stepping beyond the circle of light I peered into
the gloom. Lady Sarah&#8217;s figure was dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
visible, a patch of gray against the blackness.
Joining her we strolled well beyond ear-shot. And
yet we did not speak.</p>

<p>What was in our hearts lay too deep for words.
It was the moment of supreme renunciation. She
looked long and searchingly in my eyes and at
last words came.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Sheik!&#8221; she murmured, resting her hands
on my shoulders.</p>

<p>I drew her, trembling, to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Sarah,&#8221; I whispered, lifting her heavy
fringe of bobbed hair that she might hear
my low heart&#8217;s cry, &#8220;my Sarah of the Sahara,
we have had our little hour, thee and I. Now,
by the law of thy people we must part. But
by the law of my adopted people, the Moplahs,
thou art mine, my desert woman, my sweet sand
lark.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back affrighted. Though I had
spoken before in an exalted strain I had never so
definitely approached the topic of love. Then she
took my hand again.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, El-Dhub,&mdash;&#8221; she said, &#8220;what you say is
sweet and true. Thy words are as the nightingale&#8217;s
song. My heart and my love are indeed thine, but
see how I am encompassed ... By all the laws of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
my people I am bound to my over-lord yonder....
I can not free myself....&#8221;</p>

<p>From the glowing tent burst a wild strain of
harmonica music, fierce, exultant.</p>

<p>&#8220;God pity me!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Choking with emotion I staggered to the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swank!&mdash;Whinney!&mdash;we start at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>They tumbled from their places.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad! At this hour? Man alive....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.... Call Ab-Domen ... he and
I will start ahead with four camels. I must ride
tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they obeyed my order Lady Sarah slipped
by me into the tent, her eyes dark with pain. Ab-Domen
sleepily led out a small group of camels
and the necessaries for our advance party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Due East,&#8221; I said to Whinney, &#8220;leave out
Tabala and proceed to the next station at Hammababa.
We will await you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o&mdash;Goodbye ... and good luck. We
ought to get there in three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friends turned in for they needed sleep badly.
A few moments later Ab-Domen and I were
ready for departure. Suddenly a piercing scream
rang from the Wimpoles&#8217; tents and Lady Sarah
rushed into the night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;El-Dhub!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, take me with you. Look ... he has done
it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held up her arm and I saw the deep teeth-marks
of her dog of a husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn him.... I will kill him &#8217;ere we go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I think I have done that....
I struck him ... with a chafing dish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up, then ... mount.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her place on one of the camels. There
was no thought of hesitation. Forth we fared on
the swiftest of my bactrians forth into the velvet
night. Our camels travelled tactfully side by side.
So matched were their gaits that Lady Sarah could
rest her head on my shoulder as we rode. It was
not until six hours later, in the dawn, that I discovered
that sometime during the night Ab-Domen,
the wily old devil, had given us the slip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; I lowered my binoculars.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Straordinary!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sarah spoke casually but I detected the
undertone of anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p>We had now been three days in the desert. To
put the matter shortly, we were lost. Gaze as we
might there was no sign of the Hammababa station
nor of any other. Ab-Domen Allah&#8217;s defection
had doubtless been well-meant. Under more
sophisticated conditions he had acted similarly before;
but his absence now was deadly serious.
Versed as he was in the art of star-reading, a member
in good standing of the Desert Trails Club, it
would have been simple for him to set us on the
right track. Also, relying on his knowledge I had
taken no pains to look up constellations, distances,
or direction. Our progress was a blind advance,
made the more so by our blinding love.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Ah, Sarah, my desert dish, canst thou forget that
joyous pilgrimage neath the myriad eyes of night,
throughout which I ever remained thy slave, reverent,
respectful, devoted?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, we should have come up with
Hammababa long ago but never so much as a
palm frond had we seen. The devil of a camel is
that once off the proper direction he keeps right
on in the wrong one without the slightest deviation.
Nothing like instinct ever troubles them.
The desert is sprinkled with the bones of fool
beasts that have pursued this single-track policy
into places where there wasn&#8217;t a sign of sustenance
and where they have just naturally died.</p>

<p>This thought did not cheer me any more than
the condition of our water supply. I figured that
if we had overshot Hammababa we might possibly
hit the water-hole at Rhat, but this was a long
chance which I should have hated to back with any
real money.</p>

<p>When one is lost in the desert one doesn&#8217;t say
much about it. It is not at all like being on the
wrong road in a motor where a man&#8217;s wife always
knows he is wrong and loudly proclaims it. Lady
Sarah was a trump; she never peeped. We just
kept plodding on late at night and early in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
morning, resting during the heat of the day and
neither of us voicing our suspicions. Finally on
the morning of the fourth day I thought it was up
to me to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Lady Sarah,&#8221; I began&mdash;&#8220;I suspect
that this sort of thing isn&#8217;t getting us anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowhere that matters apparently,&#8221; she said
calmly. Then, pointing skyward. &#8220;Have you
seen those kites?&#8221;</p>

<p>I <i>had</i> seen them, first one, then two ... then
two more ... appearing for just a second in the
sky, then vanishing, and I knew what they meant.
Shaking off a chill of forboding I dismissed the
foul creatures with an intrepid wave of my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our bones were not born to be bleached,&#8221; I said
cheerily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping,&#8221; was the brave reply.</p>

<p>Thus began the fourth day. It was a day of
forced riding. Riding the lead-camel I urged the
beasts to their best gait, keeping a close eye on my
pocket compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hew to the East, let the sand fall where it
may,&#8221; was my thought. Pad ... fell the
cushioned feet of our animals, pad ... pad ...
pad ... mile after mile into nothingness. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
noon until four o&#8217;clock we rested, then, on&mdash;until
nearly midnight when we sank exhausted for a
few hours&#8217; sleep. Food and water supply were
running low. &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;we <i>must</i>
find something!&#8221; closing my eyes on the desperate
hope.</p>

<p>I awoke to a fresh catastrophe. In organizing
our flight-caravan Ab-Domen had included an
extra pack-camel, an Asian dromedary, the meanest
type known to man. This made five beasts in
all. Due to thirst and exhaustion they were nervous
and irritable. The sound which aroused me
was a loud roar almost human in its savageness.</p>

<p>The dromedary had attacked my high spirited
mount and before I could shout a word of command
or interfere in any way the entire group
were mixed in an inextricable battle-royal. A
fight between two camels is a dangerous thing to
approach; five made a storm center which was as
menacing as a buzz-saw.</p>

<p>Amid a wild bellowing they charged, bumped,
bit, kicked, whirled and fell, lashing, thrashing,
smashing ... my heart sank as I heard the
rending crack of bone against bone. After a mad
half-hour they lay compactly locked, exhausted,
blood-shot, panting and glaring, hump locked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
hump, teeth bedded in soft flesh, legs protruding
at every angle like a pile of animal jack-straws.</p>

<p>When I was able to drag them, one by one, apart
I knew that the worst had befallen us. Out of
twenty legs, seventeen were broken! Not a single
beast was able to stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tremendous, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Lady Sarah.</p>

<p>I nodded. In spite of its import the tragedy
could not fail to be spectacular.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better milk the female,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Lady Sarah managed to extract about a gallon
from our only cow-camel. With heavy hearts and
heavier loads we began our fateful march across
the wastes&mdash;afoot.</p>

<p>Just how long or how far we walked is not quite
clear in my mind. At times we were unreasonably
gay. Day and night became confused. We
struggled on when we were not too exhausted.
Snatches of an old refrain, &#8220;The Japanese Sandman,&#8221;
burst from my lips; then I would sing the
old Indian love lyric &#8220;Cold hands I held, behind
the Samo-va-ah, where are you now,&mdash;where are-ah
you now?&#8221; And we would both weep, watching
our tears vanish in the aridity underfoot, &#8220;like
snow upon the desert&#8217;s dusty face.&#8221;</p>

<p>On an undated day we lay down for what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
felt to be our last rest. We had done our best and
it was not enough. In the early dawn Fate
mocked us again. A tractor caravan passed at a
distance of half a mile, part of the regular bus line
between Tripoli and Assouan, their head lights
shining dimly in the wan light. Struggling to my
feet I tried to run toward them. Ignominious
though it might be to be rescued by such contraptions
I had another&#8217;s life to consider. &#8220;Jitney!&#8221;
I shouted&mdash;&#8220;Jitney,&#8221; but the noise of their motors
drowned my voice and, the effort proving too
much, I fell forward, gazing mournfully after the
receding tail-lights, two dim, red sparks that rose
and fell and vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; asked Lady Sarah, half-aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Citroens,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;French ... for lemons,&#8221; she said with a weak
smile, sinking again to lethargy.</p>

<p>Later in the day we managed to advance a few
miles. I think we crawled part of the way. All
supplies were now exhausted. I was burned like
a cinder; Lady Sarah was a flaming red&mdash;she
never tanned; she was peeling, I remember, but
still beautiful. Suddenly I sank back and pointed
with trembling finger&mdash;&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; I cried
through cracked lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>Before us not over a mile away, in a low depression
of the desert, lay water! blessed water,
fringed with green trees, to which I could see animals
coming to drink, impala, umpahs, gazelles and
countless birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rhat-hole,&#8221; I shouted, &#8220;Courage! dear
witch; we shall win through yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yard by yard we made our painful advance.
The details grew clearer until in my fevered
imagination I could hear the cool splash of the
pool. And then, with the suddenness of a cinema
fade-out the picture vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mirage,&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Lady Sarah had fainted.</p>

<p>A hoarse kite-cackle sounded in my ears as I
too sank in merciful oblivion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you followed the kites?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Altitude,&#8221; said Ab-Domen, &#8220;for
several days I kept away, for I thought you might
wish ... that is ... the lady ...&#8221;; he grinned
maliciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not pre-arranged,&#8221; I said coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I began to see the birds,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;I was worried. When I found your smashed
camels&mdash;by the way you were lucky in one
respect, for the beasts attracted the birds and held
them back for a day&mdash;then I was really worried.
I knew I should be useless without supplies so I
rode at top speed to the caravan, changed camels
for horses and overtook you&mdash;just in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Ab-Domen,&#8221; said Lady Sarah patting
the oriental&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>We were resting at the Rhat-hole which was not
so far away as we had supposed. The mirage we
had seen was of the close-range variety and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
we had sufficient strength to keep on we might
have reached it for ourselves.</p>

<p>Our camp was at some distance from the pool
in order not to disturb the wild life to which it is
so necessary a feature. These desert water-holes
differ in character from the South African variety.
The vegetation is less dense and more low-growing
and the animals are mostly limited to those of the
locality, jerboa, jackals, whiffle-hens and so on.</p>

<p>We did no shooting for it has always seemed to
me extremely unsporting to kill unsuspecting
animals while they are satisfying their thirst. It
was sufficiently entertaining to sit quietly in our
compound and watch the amazing variety of
visitors to the filthy but refreshing waters. Being
the only source of supply in a large area it was
occasionally visited by creatures whose natural
habitat was many miles away. Among others a
lean elephant who had evidently strayed far from
his haunts to the southward. He was one of the
lop-eared Sudanese type, almost dying of thirst.
It was interesting to see how in his case necessity
became the mother of invention for, having
drunk as much as he could, he proceeded to fill his
trunk against future need, hanging the end over
his ear in order to conserve the precious liquid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Here, too, we got our first hint of the distant
Nile country toward which we were aiming. A
group of ibis stalked along the edge of the pool
while, keeping very much to himself, I saw a
specimen of the rare Egyptian wart-hog whose
snout is spiraled to aid him in piercing the sand
in search of lizard-eggs, his favorite food.</p>

<p>Our way was now comparatively easy. We were
in the region of Anglo-Egyptian influence where
the efficiency of the British Government has
established a chain of oases at distances much nearer
than that provided by nature. Where water
does not exist in natural wells it has been reached
by boring or is piped in. Ab-Domen checked off
the list of probable station stops. Wun, Borku,
Liffi Ganda&mdash;the largest of the artesian oases,&mdash;Bongo,
Meshra and so on, straight to the Egyptian
frontier....</p>

<p>It seemed unwise to leave Ab-Domen at this
juncture for every time I had done so the results
had been unfortunate. As I looked back on my
plight in Azad&#8217;s camp and my narrow escape from
death in the company of my bronze beauty I
realized that now, if ever, was a time for playing
safe. Lord Wimpole was left behind, a thing of the
past, lost, to all intents and purposes, in the desert.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;He was carted off to Tabala the morning after
you and Lady Sarah left,&#8221; Swank told me. &#8220;He
hadn&#8217;t come-to when they started so I don&#8217;t know
how he took her departure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much I cared! I snapped my fingers.</p>

<p>Restored to health, nourished with a generous
supply of delicious food, my monumental desert
mate was more lovely than ever. The peeling
process was over and she appeared re-born, a
creature of red and gold. How I looked forward
to the Nile, with all its romantic associations.</p>

<p>The river came in sight at last after what seemed
interminable days crossing the low Wady Mahall
hills. Late one afternoon I caught its silver sheen
where it wound its way between the fresh green of
the rice fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; I pointed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Nile, O, my beloved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Antony!&#8221; ... she scarcely breathed the
name. She was really wonderful in her way of
catching the spirit and elevation of the moment;
her early education must have been thorough.</p>

<p>Our last day&#8217;s march was through fields of
Egyptian cotton and Lady Sarah made a remark
that startled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horace owns slathers of this,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>I grimaced at the name which showed she was
thinking of him, and quickly drew her attention
to a lovely field of sesame and lilies planted in alternate
rows. Here and there a band of native
workmen were weeding the vegetable-ivory-plants
in preparation for the annual inundation. So
shallow was the alluvial loam that their rude implements
frequently reached the underlying sand
rich with the records of past centuries, for this
entire valley is but the graveyard of earlier civilizations.
Our passing excited mild wonder and one
brawny Nubian tossed me a skull which Whinney
said was clearly that of a man of the bone-age.
How petty seemed the ticking of my wrist-watch
measured by the chronology of these mute memorials!</p>

<p>We intercepted the river in its upper reaches
between the third and fourth cataracts, which are
little more than rapids. In the village of Hannik
we rested, part of the caravan continuing to Red
Sea ports while my camels guided by Ab-Domen
turned northward along the river bank. Acting as
my advance agent the faithful Turk made splendid
arrangements for river boats between the cataracts
and lower down at Assouan I found a magnificent
dahabeah.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>It was the most comfortable craft of its kind
that could be devised and was painted a brilliant
emerald green, Lady Sarah&#8217;s favorite color. Ab-Domen
had not overlooked her name, El-Sali, in
the vernacular, which adorned the bow. Crew,
supplies, all were in readiness.</p>

<p>In the cabins lay fresh clothes suited to the
locality and climate. A native <i>fellah</i> in immaculate
white bounded forth whenever I clapped
my hands while Lady Sarah&#8217;s needs were looked
after by a dusky Syrian maid who fawned at her
feet or swung her fan until we sent her away on
one pretext or another. My desert queen was a
gorgeous picture when she first mounted the companion-way
steps and stood under the green and
white awning. She wore a <i>kaftan</i> or portiere of
brilliant blue draped over her shoulders, its fringe
in which were hung small silver bells, reaching to
her knees. This was supplemented by green silk
trousers of ankle length, sandals and a soft scarf.
All nails, both toe and finger, were bright with
rouge and the underlids of her eyes were deep
blue with native Kohl. She was an arresting
sight.</p>

<p>Everywhere were jewels or pendant ornaments,
bangles for wrist and ankle, and long jade earrings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
so that she clinked when she walked like a
tray-full of drinks. I had donned a light weight
burnous of two-inch striped material suitable for a
man in the early forties and discarded my heavy
Moplah turban for a <i>tarbush</i>. Our servants,
overcome by our beauty, backed down the companion-way
crying upon Allah to protect them
from such blighting splendor.</p>

<p>Of all the days of my life those which succeeded
are perhaps the most beautiful. Can one imagine
more exquisite conditions? Alone with the object
of one&#8217;s adoration on the wonderful Nile, the most
sentimental and sedimental of rivers. It was a
voyage through Paradise, the life of lovers in
lotus-land....</p>

<p>Swank and Whinney, in a smaller craft, followed
our course. For the passengers of El-Sali
life was an uninterrupted dream. Day followed
bright day in this rainless land while we drifted
lazily on our way watching the panorama of palms
and quiet river-life, natives gathering locusts from
which they squeezed the honey, green-and-gold
ichneumons flashing in the sun, shimmering fields
of henna and fragrant basil, fishermen seeking
ancient carp and the curious <i>boyad</i> which has
feathers in place of scales, children playing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
a <i>tetrodon</i> or ball-fish which they toss about gaily,
whispering groves of mulberry trees, marshes
pink with mallow amid which stood flaming
flamingos and ibis both sacred and profane, water
buffalo, okaki, coneys ... there was no end to
the variety and interest. Occasionally we stopped
at native villages and wandered in to the little
bazaars inspecting the curious wares, purchasing
here and there a graceful reed basket, an ornament
of native turquoise and silver or a roughly cut
emerald from the mines at Jebel Zabara.</p>

<p>Ab-Domen had given orders for our entertainment
and nightly we were hailed by dancers and
singers from the shore or in boats. These came
aboard, Swank and Whinney joined us and we
watched their performances. Some of the dervishes
were remarkable.</p>

<p>Further down the river we began to pass the
tombs and monuments of the ancient dynasties and
here the entertainments became more and more
elaborate for Ab-Domen cleverly utilized the
crumbling temples, gigantic columns and seated
figures as a background for the performers. At
the temple of Philae, notably, he put on a superb
show with three principals and a chorus of six
Egyptian beauties which caused Swank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Whinney to tie their dahabeah alongside forthwith.</p>

<p>Late into the starry night I sat with my loved-one,
continuing the story of my life which had
been so often interrupted, filling in the details of
my college career with its mad, glad days and
then my plunge into exploration, the wonderful
things I had accomplished, the people I had met,
the honors ... it is not my way to talk about
myself but I felt I should tell all to this wonderful
woman. She was such a superb listener, quiet,
mute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say something,&#8221; I murmured, brushing her
locks, sweet with jasmine and asphodel, &#8220;speak, my
oleander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am speechless,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I have always loved women of that sort, the
simple, quiet ones,&mdash;broad between the eyes,&mdash;are
they bovine? stupid? I do not know. They listen
to me.</p>

<p>Thus Lady Sarah lay in her <i>chaise-longue</i>,
quiet, smiling, listening to my odyssey. Sometimes
her eyes closed and it almost seemed she
slept....</p>

<p>It is not my way to pass through a country without
drawing from it as much information and interest
as possible. All my life I have been a close
student of archeology and here was an opportunity
not to be missed of pursuing certain investigations
which had been attempted by others and which I
myself had begun and abandoned when the war
called all able-bodied men to the colors.</p>

<p>Like all Englishwomen Lady Sarah had a keen
interest in investigations of this sort and heartily
seconded the suggestion that I should give a day
or two to the clearing up of some of the dynastic
mysteries which have baffled historians for many
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t go with you, my dear,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;These pyramids and sphinxes and things are
simply infested with people from home ... it
wouldn&#8217;t do, you know ... after I get my
divorce, all right, but until then....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>How sane she was!</p>

<p>I left her in the dahabeah, watched over by Ab-Domen
who had by this time safely convoyed his
camels to Cairo.</p>

<p>&#8220;For three days only,&#8221; I whispered, holding her
tightly, &#8220;more than that I could not bear,&#8221; and
without daring to look back I fled.</p>

<p>My objective was in the nearby terrain of the
Valley of Kings but I knew better than to search
in the actual valley itself which has been completely
mussed by the hundreds of excavators who
have sought the missing chapters of Egyptian
history. Here, it is true, they have found much
that is interesting and worth-while. The recent
discovery of the tomb of King Tut-Ankh-Amen
was a creditable performance. But I was after
bigger game than that!</p>

<p>In beginning my quest I was greatly aided by
certain papers which I had purchased many years
ago from an old Levantine in Aden. He knew
little of their value or I should never have secured
them but vague markings on the first documents
told me that the packet belonged originally in the
library of Alexander the Great. Later they found
their way into the archives of the Bab-el-Mandeb
himself. Need I say more?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>I therefore kept to the north of the beaten track
of exploration. The expressions on the faces of
numerous excavating parties which we passed were
amusing. They considered me insane to search
for buried testimony in a location to which no
reference was made in their data. Such is the
narrowness of many learned men.</p>

<p>Our group was small consisting of not more
than a score of <i>doolahs</i> in addition to my usual
companions Swank and Whinney. Five camels
carried the provisions and tools. The indications
contained in my papers was so precise that I felt
that I could verify their statements with very little
delay. Either they were true or false and that
could be soon determined.</p>

<p>It was necessary to lay a very careful course
following the exact compass-directions of my
palimpsest. This done we were soon swallowed
up in the immensity of the desert. It was strange
how, like a great mother, the land enveloped and
enfolded us. But now I trudged it with different
feelings for back of me, waiting in the dahabeah,
was Sarah, my tiger-mate, my tawny desert-rose!
Our plan was to go immediately to Paris where
she was to join the American divorce colony, for
she wished to be forever freed from her outrageous
husband. This being decided, I urged her to make
haste so that the teeth-marks might still be shown
in evidence, for they were rapidly paling. Wimpole!&mdash;the
cur ... what had become of him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Revolving these matters we marched on, stopping
at the end of five hours for luncheon and a
siesta. Here the <i>doolahs</i> resorted to a curious
trick for, by wriggling their bodies, they wormed
their way into the sand and completely disappeared
save for an occasional toe, elbow or kneecap
which lay, oddly detached, on the burning
floor. In this way they escaped the direct rays of
the deadly sun. Three hours later the march was
resumed.</p>

<p>Not long after I ordered a halt. We had
reached a point as near as I wished to go to the
object of my search, for it was a part of my plan
to make the actual discovery alone. Much as I
respected the two men who were with me I was
too old a bird to ignore the fact that practically
every great discovery is marred by an attempt to
divide the credit. In matters of this sort it is best
to be alone.</p>

<p>Camp for the night being established I quietly
strolled off by myself. The sun still hung well
above the horizon and I estimated that I had fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
two hours of daylight, though I took an electric
flashlight as an extra precaution. The character
of the surrounding country was peculiar in the
extreme, consisting of thousands of small dome-like
hills like bee-hives, each so like the other that
my sense of orientation was instantly lost. Not
over a half a mile from camp I looked for our
party and realized with a start that I was searching
in exactly the opposite direction from the
right one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful!&#8221; I thought, studying my compass:
&#8220;this is dangerous country to travel in.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments the camp had disappeared.
Proceeding with the greatest care and constantly
consulting both my papers and my compass I
steered as straight a course as possible between
the soft hillocks. An evening wind was rising and
I noticed that its slightest breath was sufficient to
ripple the hill-sides like shaken silk. In a stronger
blast the mounds must actually move. Not
without a sense of disquiet I observed that the
landscape back of me had already changed slightly&mdash;or
did it only seem so?</p>

<p>One hour of my precious time had passed.
Should I go on&mdash;or return? Hesitating, a fresh
detail lured me forward. To the north-west and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
dominating the surrounding mounds rose one considerably
higher. According to my documents I
should now be at the site of the most astounding
discovery possible in this corner of the world. Resolved
to make a last inspection from this hill I
made my way toward it.</p>

<p>Even as I ascended its eastern side a thrill crept
up my spine for I could see that the ground sloped
sharply away to the west which, my papers said,
it should do. And on the top of the knoll I stood
aghast.</p>

<p>Yes! it was true. I had found it. I, Walter
Traprock, American, stood awed, silent and alone,
looking down into the Lost Valley of Bulls, the
burial place of Dimitrino, the First of the
Pharaohs.</p>

<p>Let me say here that I do not belittle the importance
of Tut-Ankh-Amen, but may I also
point out that he has been widely acclaimed because
he was the <i>last</i> of the Pharaohs? Dimitrino,
I repeat, was the <i>first</i>. It is obvious to whom the
greater credit must go. Year after year, for centuries,
historians have groped for some allusion,
some hint which should guide them to the spot
which lay before me.</p>

<p>The tomb occupied the center of a small valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
in which the purple dusk already lay heavy.
Against my better judgment, chuckling excitedly,
I ploughed down the sloping banks, passed between
two gigantic porphyry bulls and finally stood
beside the mausoleum itself. Though intending
to make only a cursory examination one exciting
detail led to another. The smoothly worked
granite blocks with their close joints excited my
wonder. Near the top of the dome in a band of
ornamentation I noted a bronze ring artfully
worked in the design. It was comparatively easy
to climb the curving sides and reach this stone.
It was large and I had not the faintest idea that
it would move. Imagine my surprise then when
it slid slowly under a strong pull and I gazed
down through a square opening into the blackness
of the actual burial chamber. With a thrill of
fear I bent forward, head and shoulders through
the aperture and flooded the great room with my
flashlight. Wonder of wonders! What splendors
lay below me.</p>

<p>I had only time to glimpse a dazzling array of
gold and brilliant color when my legs were suddenly
lifted up from behind and I was thrust violently
forward through the opening. Twisting as
I fell I quickly flashed my light upward. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
great stone was slowly sliding into place but in
the narrowing space the beam of my flash fell on
the distorted features of Horace Wimpole.</p>

<p>My head suddenly swam with dizziness and I
fainted.</p>

<p>My revival was sudden and violent. For a
second I lay semi-conscious; then realizing my
predicament, every fibre rebelled at the ridiculous
situation. Caught ... caught again, like a rat in
my own trap. Blindly I rushed about in the blackness
of the tomb. Underfoot resounded the crash
of fragile furniture, the splintering of priceless
relics. My head struck some sort of musical instrument
built on the tambourine order which fell
to the floor with a weird jangling of copper discs.
Then I stumbled over a great urn and lay panting
amid the fragments.</p>

<p>Where was my light? In a sickening panic I
groped for it ... thank God! my hand closed
about it almost instantly ... perspiration dripped
from my forehead. I did not press the button of
my flash at once. Somewhat calmed by its possession
I brooded bitterly, glad that the darkness
could hide me from myself. Fool! ... <i>fool</i> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
I was to have been so trapped ... to have felt
so fatuously secure. Not a thought had I given
to Wimpole during my exquisite &#8220;<i>r&ecirc;ve d&#8217;amour</i>.&#8221;
He was dismissed ... waved away like a wraith.
But he had materialized.</p>

<p>How had he done it?</p>

<p>A score of answers thronged my brain. Disguised,
perhaps he had accompanied me, mingling
with my humble <i>doolahs</i> or, more probably, had
followed me, keeping apart, weaving his way,
snake-like, through the hills, watching and waiting
to strike the dastard blow. G&#8217;r-r-r ... I ground
my teeth in impotent rage.</p>

<p>But stay ... this was idiotic. Gradually I
calmed and for the first time switched on my light.
Playing it on the ceiling I realized that all trace of
the moveable stone was lost in the complicated
decoration. Climbing a wall which curves inward
is one of the most difficult feats in the world,
though I have been able to do it in the past. But
now it seemed so futile. Any search of the ceiling
would have lacked direction. Without moving I
gazed sombrely about me.</p>

<p>I was buried alive, there was no getting away
from that. Having chewed this bitter cud for
several minutes I resolved to put my spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
house in order, so to speak. My first act was to
make my will, something I had frequently proposed
and as often postponed. It occurred to me
now that my position was probably unique in drawing
up this last testament after I had been entombed.
All that I possessed I left to Lady Sarah
in fee simple or to her heirs or assigns forever, to
have and to hold, from now on until death us do
part&mdash;the form was strictly legal and I signed
Whinney&#8217;s name as witness, per W. E. T. to make
all sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;for my last words.&#8221; In
vain I tried to evolve some simple, compact sentence
which would epitomize my entire life but the subject
was too large. Finally I compromised on a
five-hundred word obituary outlining the main
events of my career. I then recited what I could
remember of the burial service and considered that
I had been decently laid away.</p>

<p>With these rites performed I could composedly
take stock of my surroundings for it occurred to
me that I could put my time to no better use than
by writing a careful inventory of the contents of
the mausoleum. That much at least could remain
as my legacy to the culture of the world. Then
for the first time I realized the magnitude of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
discovery in which I had so completely lost myself.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those interested in archeology
I will give a mere outline of the main features, the
principal one of which was, of course, the basalt
sarcophagus of the King himself. Beside this in
a similar receptacle a few sizes smaller lay his
favorite Queen, Heck-To. Ranged about the
walls was a dazzling array of royal furniture,
boxes, chairs, beds, chariots, tables, vases and so
on. All the latter were of solid gold heavily encrusted
with gems. Many of the vessels were
filled with food but the contents of the wine jars
had unfortunately evaporated so that I could only
look forward to dry fare for a brief period.</p>

<p>The picture writing on the walls was of immense
interest and showed Dimitrino at his favorite pursuits,
hawking, hunting, catching scarabs and
playing Mah Jong which even in his day was an
old game. One intimate close-up portrayed the
monarch using a dial system telephone which the
modern world is now re-discovering with so much
trouble. Another section showed him teaching
archery to his son who afterwards became Melachrino
I.</p>

<p>Numerous passages were in verse which, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
hieroglyphics, is effected by rhyming the symbols
in idea, a bird with an egg, a bow with an arrow,
a snake with a woman, and so on. A scene very
lovely in color, depicted the Queen&#8217;s mother, Eks-Ito,
being devoured by vultures, the King and his
son looking on.</p>

<p>About the sarcophagus stood the tutelar divinities,
Psh, Shs, Pst and Tkt, the big four of their
day. The queen&#8217;s lid bore an intaglio of Thothmes
indicating that she had a hare-lip. Hundreds of
articles I listed carefully in my note-book, becoming
completely absorbed in my work.</p>

<p>Then gradually a chill horror numbed my body.
<i>My light was going out!</i> There was no doubt
about it. It was fainter than it had been. The
battery was fading. To die, thus, in the dark!
... horrible. My determination to complete my
catalogue drove me to fresh effort. Having completed
the movable objects I made a closer inspection
of the sarcophagus itself. On the top
carved in high relief lay a coiled snake. As I
reached my hand toward it, to my amazement, its
head raised and I saw the coils stiffen. Across my
brain flashed the thought that this was the King&#8217;s
&#8220;Ka,&#8221; his spiritual familiar and guardian. But no,
that was rot; the creature was alive!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Subconsciously a ray of hope sprang in my
breast. Not realizing just why, I reached my light
toward the serpent. When it had almost touched
him he glided silently over the edge of the stone,
dropped with a thud on the tiled floor and flowed
like a black stream to the edge, back of a delicate
table, where he disappeared.</p>

<p>In a frenzy I hurled the furniture out of the
way and cast myself on the floor playing my light
before me. There was the snake&#8217;s exit, where a
tile was loosened against the side wall. And if his
exit, why not mine?</p>

<p>Idiot, not to have thought of it before! The
construction of tombs is peculiar. They have practically
no foundations. In this country with no
frosts or moisture it is only necessary to go an
inch or two below the level of the hard-packed
sand. Dashing the tile aside I felt the surface below.
It was friable and crumbled easily under
my hand. Scratching the sand deeply with my
pen-knife I scraped up the top layer with a shallow
copper bowl. In another moment I was burrowing
madly like an excited mole.</p>

<p>In an hour I was completely submerged. My
flash was thrust in my breast pocket where I
could occasionally play its waning beam on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
tunnel before me. But I soon learned to do my
work in the dark, passing the sand back of me and
worming my way forward. Above me I could feel
the masonry of the enclosing wall, first on my head,
then my shoulders, waist ... legs ... I was
free of it.</p>

<p>As I began to turn my tunnel upward the sound
of a solid slump caused me to play the light over
my shoulder and look back as well as I could. A
large mass of sand had fallen from the roof of the
tunnel. Not being able to dig with my feet or to
turn in the passage any retreat was cut off. It
was do or die now and with desperate energy I
wielded my scoop.</p>

<p>Strange that I did not reach the surface! On,
on, I went and still there was no light ahead. My
sense of direction became confused. Was I going
upward or digging my grave deeper and more irrevocably
in the arid earth. My strength, unusual
though it is, was giving out and this dreadful
doubt as to my direction served further to sap my
energy. &#8220;One hundred more scoops&#8221;&mdash;I vowed
... still no air ... fifty more ... twenty-five
... ten ... one ... I broke through. Air,
blessed air, cool and refreshing as water. Panting
I lay with only my head above ground. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
was night, and such a night! blowing a gale with
the wind heavily freighted with sand. But amid
the stinging drifts I rolled over and slept the sleep
of a child.</p>

<p>The bright sun woke me and I staggered to my
feet shaking the sand from my garments and staring
stupidly before me. My experience came
back slowly like a confused dream. The tomb.
O, yes ... the tomb ... but where was it? I
rubbed my eyes. There was no tomb. And then
I realized what had happened.</p>

<p>During my incarceration the gale had heaped
the sand-drifts about my prison until it was completely
covered. No trace or trail indicated its
position. Of my tunnel there was not a vestige
and I realized why it had taken me so long to reach
the surface.</p>

<p>The entire topography had changed. Wily
old Dimitrino! To tuck his tomb away in this
shifting, evasive landscape where he was literally
here today and gone tomorrow!</p>

<p>Thank Heavens my compass could not run
down and I still had my records. At the thought
of the return trip memory re-illumined the flame
of anger but, close on its searing glow,
burst the effulgence of love. Faint from hunger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
but buoyed by my inextinguishable passion
I stumbled through the distorted territory where,
verily, as the old Hebrew says, &#8220;the little hills skip
like rams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early in the dawn I began my return. The
wind had fallen and progress was not difficult.
Once out of the curious hill country which had
again taken the lost Valley of Bulls into its embrace
it was a simple matter to locate my camp
which was the only visible object in the open desert.
My companions were overjoyed at my return for,
though an overnight absence on my part was not
unusual, they were always anxious until I put in
an appearance.</p>

<p>But their welcome was submerged in their wonder
at my orders for an immediate return to Assouan.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; questioned Swank, &#8220;we&#8217;ve
just got here, we&#8217;ve accomplished nothing;
it&#8217;s....&#8221;</p>

<p>I cut him short with a severe glance vouchsafing
only the remark &#8220;Foul play is afoot. Make haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that something serious had happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and obeyed unquestioningly. The rank and file
of my safari were delighted at the prospect of getting
back to the comforts of the more civilized
river-life. More than once it was on my lips to
tell my American companions the story of my entombment
with all its possibilities of future riches
and fame, but the thought of Lady Sarah lay too
heavily on my heart. This burden of apprehension
I must carry alone. Weighed down with my individual
anguish I plodded silently across the
sand, my mind too busy with pictures of what
might have happened to even note the signs of our
progress, the merging of the desert into the fertile
fields with their long lines of irrigation ditches, the
flourishing plantations of capsicum and marrows
alive with chattering apteryxes and flocks of four-horned
sheep.</p>

<p>With a start I realized that we were on the outskirts
of Assouan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; I said, detaching my fellow
countrymen from the natives. We ran on ahead
and soon came in sight of the El-Sali moored by
the river bank. She was ominously quiet. Bursting
into the salon I gazed upon a picture which
was the exact counterpart of my most lurid
imagining. The room was a wreck, curtains torn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
down, vases broken, rugs twisted, chairs and tables
overturned. Ab-Domen lay unconscious under
the ruins of the victrola. A low moaning from
the apartment beyond led us to Lady Sarah&#8217;s maid,
likewise in the stupor of exhaustion.</p>

<p>When at last the faithful dragoman was partially
revived he breathed a harrowing story of assault
and abduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Wimpole came ...&#8221; he gasped ... &#8220;he
had twenty men ... Lady El-Sali fought like a
tigress ... you see?...&#8221; he motioned weakly
at the surrounding chaos.... &#8220;I, too, did my best....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did they go?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Down river ... where to
I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is an excellent highway along the Nile
bank from Assouan to the Delta. In half an hour
we were on our way, mounted on the best of our
horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarah!&#8221; I screamed in my agony, &#8220;it can not be
that we have lost each other so soon!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>
<hr class="tiny" />

<p>My only hope was that Wimpole, solacing himself
with the thought that he had effectually put
me <i>hors de combat</i>, would loiter on his way. But
this ray was soon extinguished for inquiry at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
villages on our route informed us that the Englishman&#8217;s
party had gone through by motor! At the
word my heart sank; all thought of overtaking him
was out of the question. Yet, desperately, we kept
on.</p>

<p>It was late at night when the lights of Cairo
twinkled in the distance. Leaving our horses and
chartering a powerful car we were soon speeding
towards Alexandria. The first sun&#8217;s rays lighted
the listless sails and gleaming hulls of the ships at
anchor, battered tramps and giant liners from overseas,
trim yachts, an occasional sombre battleship
and thousands of sturdy fishing craft. Two vessels
were my immediate object, the Wimpole&#8217;s Undine
and my own Kawa. A long scrutiny from
the rising ground back of the Port failed to disclose
them. Parking our car we lost ourselves in the
forest of masts along the harbor&#8217;s edge. It was
impossible that Triplett had failed me but locating
him was like finding one&#8217;s automobile after a foot-ball
game. Standing on various pier heads I
cupped my hands and bellowed &#8220;Kawa-a-hoy&#8221; until
I was twice threatened with arrest by the local
constabulary. Meanwhile Swank and Whinney
were paging my captain in other directions, the
former cruising about in a rented rowboat while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
latter conducted a personal canvass of the water-side
drinking-parlors. In one of these Triplett was
eventually discovered. He was amazed at my early
arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t look fur ye fur a week,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Undine in the harbor?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuz, last night ... takin&#8217; on supplies all day;
moved out by the lighthouse at sundown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, man; let&#8217;s get aboard. We must board
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kawa lay surrounded by a huddle of small
boats the crews of which objected violently to being
shoved aside but we forced our way through and
eventually cleared the end of the pier and stood out
toward the mole, our kicker-motor chugging valiantly.
I had fetched my glasses from below and
soon located the Undine. She was nearly
two miles distant and to my consternation
showed every indication of being about to get under
weigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make better time,&#8221; I urged. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
we crowd on more sail or do something nautical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crowd on nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Triplett. &#8220;Wind&#8217;s
dead agin us.&#8221; He spat sourly as was his wont and
I knew from the glint of his one useful eye that
what man could do he would do. Foot by foot we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
crept up on the slender Undine out of whose buff
funnel smoke poured with increasing volume. We
could now see the glint of her brass work and read
the name under her stern. The squeak of the davit-blocks
reached us as the tiny launch was hauled up
and swung in-board; then came the clink, clink of
the capstan. It was up-anchor now and no mistake.</p>

<p>At that moment Swank made one of the greatest
blunders of his life and that is saying a lot. Overcome
by excitement he seized a large megaphone
and before I could stop him raised it and howled
&#8220;Undine a-hoy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; I shouted striking the instrument from
his grasp.</p>

<p>It was the very thing which he should not have
done. In quiet we might have slipped alongside.
Now all was activity aboard the yacht. Sailors
ran to and fro, bells rang sharply, the anchor swung
dripping over the bow and a lather of white foam
bubbled up from the obedient screws.</p>

<p>We were not over a hundred yards away. In
desperation I seized the megaphone. &#8220;Stop, in the
name of the law,&#8221; I shouted; it was all I could think
of at the time.</p>

<p>A harsh laugh was my answer followed by a
shriek, the well-known shriek of my beloved, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
tore my heart strings. In the salon I caught a
glimpse of two struggling figures; then, just as
other bulky forms intervened, a bright object flew
through the open porthole. At that moment the
Undine&#8217;s stern swung toward us and gathering
headway she shrank rapidly to a tiny speck on the
distant horizon.</p>

<p>We hove-to. &#8220;Lower the dingy,&#8221; I ordered.
Alone I rowed toward the bright object which I
had seen fly from the cabin window. If it were
what I hoped ... yes ... a bottle. Within was
the briefest sort of message, merely the word ...
&#8220;Ritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in my cabin I pondered in bitter perplexity.
&#8220;Ritz?&#8221; It was a call to follow her ... it was
a meeting place ... but which Ritz? There are
so many.</p>

<p>I am not one to give up easily. Gradually a
scheme formed in my mind. I would establish an
inter-Ritz communication system with agents in all
branches. Triplett&#8217;s appearance in the doorway interrupted
my ruminations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;London,&#8221; I replied and, a moment later, felt
the Kawa veer toward the great English city.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Fate in her inscrutable way was to end my search
almost before it had begun. Eight weeks later I
sat in the tea room of the Ritz-Carlton in London.
Opening my paper I scanned the headlines dealing
with cable despatches, racing news and financial exchange
until an item, brutal in its brevity, assaulted
my attention as with a hammer stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Sarah Wimpole Dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room swam about me. After a tremendous
effort at self mastery I was able to read what followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The death of Lady Sarah Wimpole, nee Alleyne,
of Alleyne House and Wimpole Manor, Nottinghamshire,
will come as a shock to her many
friends. Her medical advisors, Dr. Keech and Dr.
McGilvray, confess themselves as much mystified
by the nature of the malady which has proved fatal.
In all respects the symptoms were those of hydrophobia,
which is not an admissible diagnosis since
Lady Wimpole had but just recently landed from
her yacht, the Undine, upon which she and Lord
Wimpole have been cruising in Eastern waters. It
is suspected that the disease may have been conveyed
by a parrot of which the defunct Peeress was
very fond and the bird&mdash;very wisely in our opinion&mdash;has
been destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>How clearly the tragedy stood before my eyes.
Wimpole, mad cur that he was, had had his way!
My first impulse was to shoot him down as he deserved.
Second thought said no. Let him live
out his wretched life until un-reason claimed him as
she was bound to do. Within a year he was incarcerated,
a hopeless maniac, fighting and biting at
his keepers.</p>

<p>Time has softened the pain of this, my most
tragic adventure. Out of the wreckage of my
hopes and dreams the lovely moments rise like
mountains from mist. Sitting alone in my study,
brooding over the romances of my life, none has
quite the charm of this, the most disastrous and incomplete.</p>

<p>It was my plan&mdash;after Lady Sarah&#8217;s divorce and
our marriage&mdash;to return to the desert where we had
great plans for commercial development, the building
of sand-paper mills and hour-glass factories,&mdash;but
there! These were but bubbles blown away by
the touch of reality. With our few brief moments
of complete joy I must be content.</p>

<p>That I should return to follow out our plans
alone is inconceivable. All speaks too clearly of
her influence who called me back to reign
once more as El-Dhub ak Moplah. The sandy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
desert is her likeness. The smooth flowing Nile
retains her reflection. The rocky features of
the Sphinx are those of my Sarah of the Sahara.
Wullahy!</p>

<p>A delicious literary burlesque&mdash;superlatively
amusing. Here
are found the <i>wak-wak</i>, that
horrid super-seamonster; the
gallant <i>fatu-liva</i> birds who lay
square eggs; the flowing <i>hoopa</i>
bowl, and the sensuous <i>nabiscus</i>
plant; the tantalizing, tatooing,
fabulous folk music; the beautiful,
trusting Filbertine women
and their quaint marriage customs, as well as the
dread results of the white man&#8217;s coming&mdash;all described
with a frank freedom, literary charm, and meticulous
regard for truth which is delightful.</p>

<p>The Cruise of the Kawa stands unique among the
literature of modern exploration. Nothing like it has
ever come out of the South Seas. It is <i>the</i> travel book
of years. Strikingly illustrated, too, from special
photographs, it tells pictorially, as well as verbally, the
exciting, amusing, and entertaining story of an exploration
in the South Seas.</p>

<p>Similar in format to the
famous <i>Cruise of the
Kawa</i>, this new volume
carries the reader on an
exciting and riotously
funny expedition to the
frozen north. It is an
account of the adventures
of the redoubtable
Dr. Traprock (and party)
who set out to discover the real North Pole&mdash;but
undertake their voyage in a most unusual
manner. The incidents, accidents, and
final discoveries in this merry burlesque are
certain to afford as much, if, indeed, not more
enjoyment than the first <i>Kawa</i> story.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
